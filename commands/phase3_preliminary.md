  ```sql
  -- Get foundational citations for concept context
  SELECT * FROM citations WHERE top_15_priority = 1 AND category = 'foundational';
  ```
- **Advanced Option**: For comprehensive concept extraction with full context, use Gemini CLI:
  ```bash
  gemini --yolo -p "@Working_Docs/phase1_ingestion/article_text.txt @Working_Docs/phase1_ingestion/metadata.json
  
  CONTEXT: This dicynodont research involves complex anatomical terminology, phylogenetic concepts, and paleontological methodologies that require careful definition for general audience understanding.
  
  BACKGROUND: Key concepts likely include:
  - Dicynodont anatomy and classification
  - Phylogenetic analysis methods
  - Triassic period context
  - Fossil preservation and interpretation
  - Comparative morphology
  
  TASK: Extract and define all key technical terms, scientific concepts, and methodologies with:
  - Technical definitions for accuracy
  - Accessible explanations for general audiences
  - Importance to the overall study
  - Cross-references to background literature
  
  OUTPUT: Save comprehensive concept definitions as JSON to Working_Docs/phase3_preliminary/key_concepts.json
  
  Please confirm understanding and provide progress updates during analysis (15-20 minute timeout recommended)."
  ```
- **Process**:
  - Identify technical terms requiring explanation
  - Define concepts in both technical and accessible language
  - Assess concept importance to overall study
  - Cross-reference with background research using TXT files
- **Output**: `Working_Docs/phase3_preliminary/key_concepts.json`
- **Format**:
```json
{
  "concepts": [
    {
      "term": "Scientific Term",
      "definition": "Technical definition",
      "general_explanation": "Accessible explanation",
      "importance": "Why this matters to the study"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3.3 Knowledge Gap Analysis
- **Action**: Identify areas requiring additional research or clarification
- **Citation Context**: Query SQLite database for areas needing deeper investigation:
  ```sql
  -- Identify unavailable top priority citations
  SELECT * FROM citations WHERE top_15_priority = 1 AND pdf_available = 0;
  
  -- Find methodological references for comparison
  SELECT * FROM citations WHERE category = 'methodological';
  ```
- **Advanced Option**: For comprehensive gap identification with full context, use Gemini CLI:
  ```bash
  gemini --yolo -p "@Working_Docs/phase1_ingestion/article_text.txt @Working_Docs/phase1_ingestion/metadata.json
  
  CONTEXT: This dicynodont research builds on existing literature but may have gaps where cited references are unavailable or where methodology needs clarification.
  
  BACKGROUND: Potential knowledge gaps in dicynodont research typically include:
  - Comparative anatomy limitations

## Command Overview
Conduct thorough section-by-section analysis, develop technical concept explanations, and assess detailed significance and implications.

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: Read FILE_USAGE_GUIDE.md First!**
📍 **Location**: `Working_Docs/phase2_citations/FILE_USAGE_GUIDE.md`

**Essential Context Efficiency Guidelines**:
- ✅ **USE**: `downloaded_articles/*.txt` files for literature analysis

## Processing Steps

### 4.1 Section-by-Section Deep Dive
For each major section (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion):

- **Action**: **ULTRATHINK** - Analyze section in detail with full context
- **Literature Context**: Query SQLite database for relevant citations per section:
  ```sql
  -- For Introduction section background
  SELECT * FROM citations WHERE introduction_mention = 1 AND top_15_priority = 1;
  
  -- For Methods section comparisons
  SELECT * FROM citations WHERE category = 'methodological' AND pdf_available = 1;
  
  -- For Results section validation
  SELECT * FROM citations WHERE category = 'comparative' AND year >= 2015;
  ```
- **Advanced Option**: For comprehensive section analysis with full context, use Gemini CLI:
  ```bash
  gemini --yolo -p "@Working_Docs/phase1_ingestion/article_text.txt @Working_Docs/phase1_ingestion/metadata.json @Working_Docs/phase3_preliminary/initial_summary.md @Working_Docs/phase3_preliminary/key_concepts.json
  
  CONTEXT: Deep analysis of the Methods section in this dicynodont research, building on preliminary analysis and key concepts identified in Phase 3.

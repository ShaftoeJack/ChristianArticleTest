## 1. SPECIMEN PREPARATION AND EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES

### 1.1 Material Documentation and Curation

**Specimen Provenance and Association**:
The authors establish exceptional documentation standards by:
- **Single-locality Focus**: All material (ZPAL V. 34/1/1-208) derives from a single association at Woźniki, Grabowa Formation, Southern Poland
- **Individual Association**: Authors provide strong evidence for single-individual association based on "congruent size and stage of ossification, and lack of duplicated elements"
- **Systematic Numbering**: Unified specimen prefix (ZPAL V. 34/1/) with individual element numbering following established protocols (Sulej et al. 2011)

**Preservation Documentation**:
The authors provide sophisticated taphonomic analysis:
- **Differential Preservation**: Detailed documentation of preservation differences between right (better preserved, smooth beige surfaces) and left (more worn, reddish, cracked) sides
- **Taphonomic Interpretation**: Authors propose "gradual burial" as mechanism for differential preservation, with varied scavenger access and taphonomic conditions
- **Ontogenetic Assessment**: Clear documentation of immaturity indicators including "inconspicuous development of articular structures," "open transcortical canals," and "lack of fusion of scapulocoracoid, cranial, and neurocentral sutures"

### 1.2 Specimen Inventory and Condition Assessment

The authors provide detailed condition assessments for 37 catalogued elements:
- **Cranial Elements**: 8 skull bones with precise damage documentation (e.g., "missing posterodorsal tip of the preparietal process")

Historical fossil specimens from the lower Elliot Formation are identified as representing a large-bodied dicynodont, the first known
from skeletal material in the Late Triassic of South Africa. Although fragmentary, these fossils differ from all other known Triassic
dicynodonts and are here described as a new taxon, Pentasaurus goggai gen. et sp. nov. Pentasaurus can be distinguished from other
Triassic dicynodonts by a number of mandibular characters, most importantly the well-developed, unusually anteriorly-positioned
lateral dentary shelf. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Pentasaurus is a placeriine stahleckeriid. Placeriines include the latestsurviving dicynodonts but their remains are primarily known from the Northern Hemisphere, with their only previously-known
Southern Hemisphere representative being the Middle Triassic Zambian taxon Zambiasaurus. The discovery of a placeriine in the Late
Triassic of South Africa supports recent proposals that local climatic conditions, not broad-scale biogeographic patterns, best explain the
observed distribution of Triassic tetrapods. The tetrapod fauna of the lower Elliot Formation is highly unusual among Triassic assemblages in combining ‘relictual’ taxa like dicynodonts and gomphodont cynodonts with abundant, diverse sauropodomorph dinosaurs.

INTRODUCTION
The Naturhistorisches Museum Wien houses a small but
historically important collection of vertebrate fossils from
the Karoo Supergroup of South Africa. The vast majority
of these specimens were collected by the famous fossil
hunter Alfred Brown, a reclusive and eccentric Englishman who spent most of his life in Aliwal North, Eastern
Cape Province. Brown was one of the first collectors to
find tetrapod fossils in the Late Triassic–Early Jurassic
Stormberg Group; previous Karoo tetrapod fossils had
mostly been found in the stratigraphically lower (midPermian–Middle Triassic) Beaufort Group (e.g. Bain 1845;
Owen 1859). Brown’s earliest fossil discoveries were made
in the 1860s, and in 1866 he shipped a crate containing 350
fossil specimens to the noted geologist Sir Roderick Impey
Murchison in London. The contents of this crate were
immediately recognized by Thomas Huxley as containing
the first definitive dinosaur remains from South Africa,
including ‘the thigh-bones of a great Dinosaurian reptile
as big as Megalosaurus [sic] and probably nearly allied to
it’ (Drennan 1938, p. 37), which were soon described as
Euskelesaurus brownii (Huxley 1866; note that although
another South African dinosaur, Massospondylus carinatus,
had been described earlier [Owen 1854], Owen did not
recognize that taxon as dinosaurian, instead classifying it
as a lacertilian). Brown promised to send additional crates

of material following the recognition of Euskelesaurus,
but because of late replies and general disinterest on
Murchison’s part, Brown soured on the deal and the
London palaeontological establishment in general. Subsequent interactions with Parisian researchers left him similarly cold and increasingly skeptical of collaboration with
European scientists, but he later accepted an offer from
Nathaniel Adler, Consul for the Austrian Empire in Port
Elizabeth, to send fossil shipments to the K.k. Naturhistorisches Hofmuseum (Imperial Museum of Natural
History) in exchange for recognition as a Fellow of the
Imperial and Royal Geographical Society of Vienna
(Drennan 1938).
The Brown collections in Vienna consist of two major
lots, accessioned in 1876 and 1886. The 1886 lot is composed primarily of fossils from the Middle Triassic
Burgersdorp Formation (mostly specimens of the kannemeyeriiform dicynodont Kannemeyeria simocephalus,
including the holotype skull of that species; Fig. 1D) and
the Early Jurassic upper Elliot Formation (mostly specimens of small sauropodomorph dinosaurs; Fig. 1C). The
1876 lot is more intriguing, as it seems to be made up
almost entirely of specimens from the Late Triassic lower
Elliot Formation. Galton & Van Heerden (1998) reviewed
the complicated history of Brown’s early finds in the
lower Elliot and their subsequent diaspora into European

collections. They concluded that the London, Paris, and
Vienna shipments were, per Brown’s own testimony
(Broom 1911), all collected at the same locality. Seeley
(1894) identified this locality as Barnard’s Spruit (a stream
to the south of Aliwal North), and although alternatives
have been proposed (Haughton 1924), current scholarship supports Barnard’s Spruit as the type locality for
‘Euskelesaurus brownii’ and associated material (Yates
2007).
Much to Brown’s chagrin, nearly nothing was done
with his fossils by researchers in Vienna, other than the
description by Weithofer (1888) of the skull of Dicynodon
(=Kannemeyeria) simocephalus. Huene (1906) later described
a massive partial femur (broken into proximal [NHMW
1886-XV-39] and distal [NHMW 1876-VII-B-124] portions)
from this collection as a specimen of Euskelosaurus (?) sp.
[sic]. Galton (1985) reexamined this specimen (Fig. 1E–J)
and made it the holotype of a new taxon of enormous
herrerasaurian dinosaur, Aliwalia rex. Referral of Aliwalia
to the predatory clade Herrerasauria was based on its possession of a well-defined and medially-directed femoral
head with a constricted neck, prominent lesser trochanter
lacking a dorsal process, and a large, protruding, proximally-positioned fourth trochanter. Seemingly corroborating this identification was a large maxilla bearing
serrated, blade-like teeth (NHMUK R3301) among the
material from Barnard’s Spruit (Seeley 1894), which

Galton (1985) referred to A. rex. Paul (1988) estimated that
Aliwalia would have weighed ~1.5 tons, making it easily
the largest dinosaurian carnivore of the Triassic and rivalling later Mesozoic taxa such as Allosaurus in size. Unfortunately for fans of giant theropods, however, Yates (2007)
recognized that the type femur of A. rex actually represents a basal sauropodomorph (‘prosauropod’), and
furthermore could be referred to the long-ignored lower
Elliot taxon Eucnemesaurus fortis van Hoepen, 1920. As part
of this revision, Yates (2007) removed the referred maxilla
from the hypodigm of ‘Aliwalia’, recognizing it only as
belonging to an indeterminate predatory archosaur.
In addition to the ‘Aliwalia rex’ holotype, almost all of the
other elements in the 1876 lot can be identified as lower
Elliot fossils probably collected along Barnard’s Spruit.
These elements all show a similar style of preservation,
concordant with that of ‘Aliwalia’ in that they are fragmentary, weathered, and consist of brownish-grey bone in a
fine-grained brown sandstone. Among these elements are
three jaw fragments (NHMW 1876-VII-B-111, 112, and
113; Fig. 2) preserving the roots of large teeth comparable
in proportions to those of NHMUK R3301. Although too
fragmentary for definite identification, given their size
they likely represent a ‘rauisuchian’ (a group previously
considered present in the lower Elliot Formation based on
dental [Kitching & Raath 1984] and footprint [Olsen &
Galton 1984] records). The preservation of these elements

is in obvious contrast to the reddish bones in purplish-red
mudstone characterizing Brown’s Burgersdorp and
upper Elliot collections (Fig. 1). Although Barnard’s Spruit
cuts through both the lower and upper Elliot formations
(E. Bordy pers. comm.), Eucnemesaurus (= ‘Aliwalia’) is
considered restricted to the lower Elliot based on subsequent discoveries of the taxon (McPhee et al. 2015). Thus,
all available evidence indicates that the ‘Aliwalia rex’
holotype and most of the rest of the 1876 lot originated
in the lower Elliot Formation. The only specimens in
the 1876 lot that do not appear to be from the lower
Elliot Formation are a pair of Lystrosaurus skulls (NHMW
1876-VII-B-106, L. declivis, and NHMW 1876-VII-B-107,
L. murrayi) preserved in a greenish-grey mudstone typical
of the Early Triassic Katberg Formation (Groenewald
1996; Damiani et al. 2003).
Recent reexamination of the entirety of Brown’s collection in Vienna has revealed that in addition to the
‘Aliwalia’ femur and aforementioned jaw fragments,
several clearly non-archosaurian elements are present
among the materials of the 1876 lot. Remarkably, a number of these elements can be positively identified as
belonging to a kannemeyeriiform dicynodont. Although
dicynodonts are known from the Late Triassic of Europe
(Dzik et al. 2008) and the Americas (Kammerer et al. 2013),
dicynodont body fossils have never previously been
reported from the Elliot Formation. There are, however,
previous suggestions of a dicynodont in the lower Elliot
based on the ichnofossil record. Ellenberger (1970, 1972)
described a series of large, short-toed, pentadactyl tracks
(Pentasauropus incredibilis) and identified the trackmaker
as either a sauropod or dicynodont, with the latter identification supported by most subsequent authors (e.g.
Olsen & Galton 1984; Anderson et al. 1998; D’Orazi
Porchetti & Nicosia 2007). Hunt & Lucas (2007) admitted
that the only obvious trackmaker for Pentasauropus is a
dicynodont, but still questioned this identification
because of the absence of dicynodont body fossils in the
later Triassic (Norian–Rhaetian). The discovery of dicynodont remains among Brown’s lower Elliot collections
provides the first skeletal evidence for this clade in the
Late Triassic of South Africa and supports the identification of Pentasauropus as a dicynodont track. The lower
Elliot dicynodont is part of a surprisingly robust assortment of ‘relictual’ therapsid elements in this fauna (e.g.
the large, herbivorous cynodonts Scalenodontoides and a
Diademodon-like taxon; Gow & Hancox 1993; Abdala et al.
2007) and suggests that patterns of faunal replacement in
the Late Triassic of southern Africa were more complex
than previously thought.

Given the lack of overlapping elements and comparable

considered speculative, however, particularly given the

Etymology. From the ichnogenus Pentasauropus Ellenberger, 1970, in a reversal of the historical tendency to
name tetrapod track ichnogenera by appending the suffix
‘-pus’ (meaning ‘foot’) to the generic stem of the supposed
trackmaker (e.g. Anchisauripus, Dicynodontipus, Megalosauropus). Named in reference to its status as the probable
trackmaker of the Pentasauropus tracks from the lower
Elliot Formation. Species named in honor of its collector,
Alfred Brown (1834–1920), nicknamed ‘Gogga’ (pronounced 'PZPc [IPA]; Afrikaans for ‘bug’) in reference to
his eccentric habits. Initially derogatory, this nickname
was later celebrated (Drennan 1938). Brown was greatly
disappointed in the lack of attention given to his discoveries by European researchers; this species name may be
taken as extremely belated recognition of his collection efforts on behalf of the Imperial Natural History Museum of
Austria-Hungary.
Diagnosis. Distinguished from all other known dicynodonts by the morphology of the lateral dentary shelf
(highly discrete and robust, nearly straight, and positioned very anteriorly on the dentary ramus, with no
apparent contact with the mandibular fenestra). Distinguished from non-stahleckeriid dicynodonts by the
remarkably large contribution of the splenial to the
anteroventral face of the jaw symphysis. Distinguished
from non-placeriine stahleckeriids by the relatively tall,
steeply-sloping mandibular symphysis and the presence
of a midline ridge on the anteroventral face of the
symphysis. In addition to the aforementioned morphology of the lateral dentary shelf, distinguished from
Placerias by the generally broader symphysis with more
rounded edges, shallower mid-dentary groove on the
dorsal surface of the symphysis, larger, rounder dentary
table, and absence of accessory grooves lateral to the
midline symphysial ridge. Based on referred elements,
further distinguished from all other dicynodonts
by the extreme robusticity of the distal humerus (greatly
anteroposteriorly expanded) and the presence of
paired rugosities on the posterolateral margin of the
frontals.
DESCRIPTION
NHMW 1876-VII-B-114. Holotype. A partial mandible
preserving the symphysis (missing the tip of the beak)
and part of the left mandibular ramus (Figs 3A, 4A, 5B, 6,
7A, 8E). This is a large, fused element unmistakably
dicynodontian in morphology. The anterior face of the
symphysis is 15.1 cm high and 9.7 cm wide. Dorsally, the
mid-dentary groove is very shallow compared to other
kannemeyeriiforms, even Placerias (a taxon in which the
mid-dentary groove is already shallower than in
stahleckeriines or kannemeyeriids; Fig. 3B). Lateral to the
mid-dentary groove are paired dentary tables (sensu
Angielczyk & Rubidge 2013; Fig. 3A). The right dentary
table is worn but the left is intact and well preserved. It is a
rounded structure, flattened dorsally, similar in morphol106

ogy to that of Stahleckeria (Fig. 7C) but transversely
broader than that of Placerias (Fig. 3B). It is separated
by a short depression from the raised edge of the dentary
that would surround the posterior dentary sulcus anterolaterally (the sulcus itself is not preserved). The anteroventral face of the jaw symphysis bears a well-developed
midline ridge (Fig. 4A). This ridge is most prominent at the
dorsal edge of the symphysis, sloping downwards
posteroventrally and seemingly terminating before the
suture with the splenial (although damage in this region
makes this somewhat uncertain). This morphology differs
sharply from that of Kannemeyeria, in which the ridge is
longer (potentially correlated with the proportionally
shorter splenial in that taxon) and flanked on both
sides by elongate symphysial grooves (Figs 4B, 5E). It
also differs from Placerias, in which the midline ridge is
similar in position and morphology but is also flanked
by well-developed accessory grooves. These grooves
extend far enough ventrally in Kannemeyeria and Placerias
that their absence in NHMW 1876-VII-B-114 cannot be
explained solely by loss of the beak tip in this specimen.
The jaw symphysis of Pentasaurus further differs from that
of Placerias in being proportionally broader (Figs 3A, 4A)
and gently rounded between its anterior and lateral faces,
unlike the sharp edges between these surfaces in Placerias
and Stahleckeria (Fig. 5C,F).
The lateral dentary shelf is preserved on the left mandibular ramus (Figs 6, 7A). The shelf is nearly horizontal
for most of its length, but curves slightly dorsally at
its posterior end. It is remarkably robust and situated
unusually far forward on the jaw compared to the condition in other kannemeyeriiforms (Fig. 7). In most dicynodonts the lateral dentary shelf is intimately associated
with the mandibular fenestra (King 1988); in NHMW
1876-B-VII-114 there is no clear evidence of the mandibular fenestra being preserved, yet a clear posterior terminus
of the lateral dentary shelf appears to be present. The
atypical morphology of this structure raises the question
of whether it represents a lateral dentary shelf at all or
could be an affixed, unrelated bone fragment. However,
careful examination of this specimen indicates that this
structure is indeed contiguous with the rest of the jaw.
It may have been somewhat distorted by taphonomic
processes (its anterior tip is highly abrupt and appears
damaged), but does appear to represent a natural part of
the jaw bone.
The splenial makes a very large contribution to the
ventral portion of the symphysis, as is typical of dicynodontoids in general and stahleckeriids in particular
(Fig. 5). It is extremely broad at the base of the symphysis,
but attenuates in width anterodorsally before ending at a
point ventral to the terminus of the midline dentary ridge.
The anteroventral face of the splenial is worn, so it is
uncertain whether any surface ornamentation (ridges,
etc.) was present on this element. Posterolateral to the
splenial, the anterior tip of the angular is preserved on the
left side of the specimen. The preserved portion of the
angular is attenuate, but remarkably broad compared to
that of non-stahleckeriid dicynodonts (compare Fig. 5B,
C,F with Fig. 5A,D).

NHMW 1876-VII-B-115. The proximal portion of a left ulna
(Fig. 8A–C), maximum length 14.8 cm. The radial notch is
well preserved (Fig. 8B,C), and the bases of the lateral and
coronoid processes are also preserved, although their tips
are worn off. In general, this element is badly worn but is
similar in morphology to that of Stahleckeria (Fig. 8D,E).
Poor preservation makes it difficult to determine whether
the olecranon was fused with the ulna or was a separate
element, as is the case in some other kannemeyeriiforms.
A separate olecranon is present in Placerias (Camp &
Welles 1956) and Ischigualastia (Cox 1965), but it is fused
ISSN 2410-4418 Palaeont. afr. (2018) 52: 102–128

with the ulna in most specimens of Stahleckeria (Huene
1935). However, at least some Stahleckeria specimens lack a
fused olecranon (Fig. 8D,E), suggesting that fusion of
this element could be variable within stahleckeriid taxa.
Because the tip of the ulna in NHMW 1876-VII-B-115
appears to be rounded and worn but not clearly broken, it
is likely that the olecranon was not fused in this particular
specimen.

part of the skull roof at the anterior edge of the intertemporal region, consisting of portions of both frontals,
the left postorbital, and the preparietal. The left
ventrolateral edge of the element is markedly curved
and bears an elongate, prominent dorsal depression,
which is interpreted as the muscle attachment site for the
adductor mandibulae on the postorbital. A large channel
cuts through this element at its posterior edge, which is
interpreted as the pineal foramen. The bone surface
108

immediately anterior to this foramen is depressed, where
the preparietal would be in other kannemeyeriiforms
(sutures are difficult to discern because of incomplete
preparation, but their interpreted locations are shown
in Fig. 9A). Outside of the depressed regions, the bone
surface is notably rugose. In particular, there are paired,
mound-like rugosities on the frontals at their borders with
the postorbitals (the right postorbital is not preserved, and
this rugosity projects freely at the edge of the specimen;

tip of the symphysis in Pentasaurus and Placerias, and present along the entire symphysial midline in Kannemeyeria. The median ridge is surrounded
by a pair of well-developed grooves also running along the length of the symphysis in Kannemeyeria, whereas the accessory grooves are short and also
restricted to the tip of the symphysis in Placerias. No accessory grooves are present in Pentasaurus. mr, median ridge; sg, symphysial groove. Anterior is

see Fig. 9A). Paired rugosities in this region are not known
in other kannemeyeriiforms (e.g. Fig. 9B,D) and may be
an autapomorphy of Pentasaurus, although the circumorbital region of Placerias is generally also very rugose
(Kammerer et al. 2013). The ventral surface of the postorbital-frontal region curves ventromedially (Fig. 9C).

the glenoid fossa being 10.0 cm in height. Although poorly
preserved, this element can be recognized as dicynodont
and not sauropodomorph or ‘rauisuchian’ by the close
proximity of the procoracoid foramen to the glenoid
fossa, the strongly posterolaterally-oriented glenoid
(more posteriorly-oriented in sauropodomorphs and
‘rauisuchians’, related to their upright gait), and the large
size of the glenoid relative to the scapular width. The
procoracoid foramen is a large (2.5 × 1.0 cm), ovoid opening entirely surrounded by the procoracoid, which is
situated anterior to the glenoid fossa and separated from
it by a distance of 3.3 cm. The procoracoid is excluded from
the glenoid by a narrow contact between the coracoid and
scapula. The posterior margin of the coracoid is strongly
concave immediately ventral to the rim of the glenoid,
as in other stahleckeriids (Fig. 10B). Unfortunately, the
scapula is broken beyond the glenoid rim, so it is unknown whether a tricipital tubercle was present.

dorsal and ventral edges of the pubis (Fig. 11A,B) are badly
worn, but the central shaft is well-preserved and exhibits
the sharp ‘twisting’ typical of kannemeyeriiforms
(Fig. 11G). The ischium (Fig. 11D,E) is highly incomplete,
and consists of a thick, worn edge of the acetabulum and a
thinning lamina extending ventrally.

element is broken at mid-shaft. The preserved base of the
deltopectoral crest indicates that it was oriented at a
nearly 90º angle relative to the long axis of the distal edge
of the humerus (Fig. 16A), similar to that of Placerias
(Camp & Welles 1956). A large, ovoid entepicondylar foramen pierces the ridge running proximally from the base of
the deltopectoral crest, as is typical for therapsids. Its exit
on the ventral face of the humerus is not visible due to
plaster reconstruction. The entepicondyle is damaged,
with part of its tip worn off. However, the sharp slope of
the preserved portion of the entepicondyle indicates that
little more of this structure would have been present, and

its total extent would have been similar to that of
Zambiasaurus (Fig. 14C). In general, the entepicondyle and
ectepicondyle would have been relatively short, like those
of other placeriines (Fig. 14B,C), and unlike the extremely
anteroposteriorly broad condyles of stahleckeriines
(Fig. 14D). On the anterior edge of the distal humerus is a
very tall, subvertical supinator process (Figs 13, 14A),
which is characteristic of placeriines (Kammerer et al.
2013; see also Fig. 14B,C) and differs sharply from that of
stahleckeriines, in which the supinator process is a
tab-like structure occupying a more restricted region
(Fig. 14D). The supinator process of Pentasaurus originates
near the base of the humeral shaft and curves proximodorsally to distoventrally, terminating near the distal tip
of the ectepicondyle (Fig. 13); it is not distinctly separated
from the ectepicondyle as in stahleckeriines and numerous other Permo-Triassic amniotes (Romer 1956). The tip
of the ectepicondyle of Pentasaurus is angled anteroventrally (Fig. 15A), as in Zambiasaurus (Fig. 15C) and unlike
Placerias and Stahleckeria in which it is angled anterodorsally (Fig. 15B, D). The tip of the entepicondyle is angled
112

posterodorsally (Fig. 15A), as in Placerias and Zambiasaurus
(Fig. 15B,D) but unlike Stahleckeria in which it is only
weakly angled, but somewhat posteroventrally (Fig. 15D).
The distal face of the humerus is massive, being very
dorsoventrally thick even compared to that of other
stahleckeriids (Fig. 15). The capitulum is mostly unossified
and would have had a thick cartilage cap in life. This is
the condition in most dicynodont humeri, including
Zambiasaurus (Figs 14C, 15C), but a well-ossified capitulum with a bulging, rounded surface is present in Placerias
(Figs 14B, 15B), stahleckeriines (Figs 14D, 15D), and some
other kannemeyeriiforms (e.g. Angonisaurus, NHMUK
R9732; Dinodontosaurus, MCN 3584; Sinokannemeyeria,
IVPP V974). Greater ossification of the distal humerus
occurs ontogenetically in therapsids (Kemp 1986), and
the unossified state of the capitulum in this specimen
(and the known Zambiasaurus humeri) may be indicative
of immaturity (although comparably-sized Placerias
humeri are well-ossified; USNM 2198, the holotype of
P. hesternus, is 16.8 cm across at its distal end and has a
prominent bony capitulum). Posterior to the capitulum on

the ventral face of the humerus is the trochlea (the articular surface for the ulna; Fig. 14A), which extends across the
distal humeral surface (Fig. 15A). Opposite the capitulum,
on the dorsal face of the humerus, is a deep and welldeveloped intercondylar groove, which surrounds the
terminus of the trochlea (Figs 12B, 15A). Extension of the
trochlea onto the dorsal humeral surface is usually the

case in kannemeyeriiforms, correlated with depression of
the humerus below the level of the glenoid fossa and
resulting in the body being held higher off the ground
than in earlier dicynodonts (Ray 2006).

The proximal surface bears a depressed articular surface
broken into two sulci (lateral and medial), for contact with
the distal condyles of the femur (Fig. 17C). A welldeveloped groove (the incisura tibialis) is present posterior to the cnemial crest. Unfortunately, the cnemial crest
and medial sulcus are badly damaged, although what is
preserved is generally consistent with that of Placerias
(Fig. 17B,D). The medial sulcus is broader than the lateral,
as is typical of kannemeyeriiforms (Camp & Welles 1956).
Given the very incomplete nature of this element, the
possibility that it could also be from a sauropodomorph
must be carefully considered. However, in Triassic sauropodomorph tibiae the proximal condyles are typically
more prominently projecting (Martínez & Alcober 2009;
Apaldetti et al. 2013) than is the case in NHMW 1876-VIIB-128. Furthermore, a natural cross-section through this
element (Fig. 16B) reveals that it has a thinner outer layer
of cortical bone than in sauropodomorphs and is extensively filled with trabecular bone, which is typical for
Triassic dicynodonts (Chinsamy 1993; Botha-Brink &
Angielczyk 2010).

radius, but this is uncertain.

NHMW 1886-XV-15. A worn, isolated vertebra missing the
neural spine (Fig. 19A–C,F,G). Maximum height from the
base of the centrum to the base of the (broken) neural
spine is 9.1 cm, transverse width of the centrum is 5.7 cm,
and anteroposterior length of the centrum is 3.6 cm. The
vertebra is amphicoelous. The pre- and postzygapophyses are broken off; their positions and rough proportions are comparable to those of other kannemeyeriiforms
(Fig. 19). The transverse processes (=diapophyses) are
short; although their tips are worn they could not have
extended much further than preserved. Given the poor
preservation of this specimen, it is difficult to be certain
where in the axial column this vertebra originated.
Cervical and dorsal vertebrae in kannemeyeriiforms
are generally similar and these series grade into each
other (Cruickshank 1975), so can be hard to tell apart
when isolated. In general, however, kannemeyeriiform
cervical vertebrae have anteroposteriorly and transversely narrower and dorsoventrally taller neural spines
and stronger curvature of the ventral surface of the
centrum than dorsals (Fig. 19; see also Pearson 1924;
Huene 1935; Bandyopadhyay 1988). The length of the
transverse process varies extensively along the length of
the vertebral column (King 1988), but is usually shorter in
the cervicals than the anterior dorsals. The position of the
parapophysis also shifts along the length of the axial
column: in anterior cervicals, the parapophysis is located
low on the anterior edge of the centrum (Fig. 19I), but it is
situated higher (near centrum mid-height) on posterior

cervicals and higher still (at the anterodorsal corner of the
lateral surface of the centrum) on anterior dorsals
(Fig. 19H). In posterior dorsals a distinct parapophysis is
absent, as it fuses to the base of the transverse process to
form a synapophysis (Bandyopadhyay 1988). Although it
is difficult to see because of wear, there appears to be the
base of a parapophysis low on the centrum in NHMW
1886-XV-15 (Fig. 19F). Combined with the relatively
concave ventral surface of the centrum, short transverse
processes, and large neural canal, this suggests that this
specimen represents a cervical vertebra. Note that this
specimen is one of a few of Brown’s lower Elliot fossils
accessioned in the later NHMW lot (1886, instead of 1876),
another being the proximal portion of the holotype femur
of ‘Aliwalia rex’ (1886-XV-39; misnumbered 1889-XV-39 by

PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS
Pentasaurus goggai was included in the most recent available phylogenetic data set for anomodonts, that of
Angielczyk & Kammerer (2017). Codings were based on
the holotype and all referred material. Three additional
characters were added to the Angielczyk & Kammerer
(2017) matrix to incorporate information pertinent for
subfamily-level identification of Pentasaurus:
172. Anterior face of dentary symphysis: 0, unornamented; 1, with median ridge.
Primitively, the dentary symphysis of dicynodonts has a
115

equals 5 cm.

weakly convex anterior face, but no distinct ridges or
grooves. Some late Permian and most Triassic dicynodonts, however, have a well-developed midline ridge on
the symphysial surface, sometimes bounded laterally by
accessory grooves. The length of the ridge varies between
taxa: in some (like Lystrosaurus) it is restricted to the dorsal
portion of the symphysis, whereas in others (like
Kannemeyeria) it extends down the entire length of
the symphysis. Among cryptodonts, a midline ridge is
present in geikiids and Oudenodon, but not Tropidostoma,
Australobarbarus, or rhachiocephalids. A midline ridge is
present in most dicynodontoids, albeit not ‘elphids’ (if
indeed they are dicynodontoids), Gordonia, Jimusaria,
Vivaxosaurus, and Dicynodon proper. Within Kannemeyeriiformes, the stahleckeriines Sangusaurus, Stahleckeria, Ischigualastia, and Jachaleria are unusual in lacking a
midline ridge (no mandibular material is known for
Eubrachiosaurus).
173. Supinator process above ectepicondyle of humerus:
0, absent; 1, present.
The supinator process is a bony ridge on the anterior
edge of the distal humerus, proximal to the ectepicondyle,
which serves as an attachment site for the supinator
muscle (Romer 1956). This process is present in many
early amniotes, and although ancestrally absent as a discrete structure in therapsids (Hopson & Barghusen 1986),
it re-evolved several times in various dicynodont groups.
Outside of Bidentalia, it is present in Dicynodontoides,
Cistecephalus, and Kawingasaurus, so may represent a synapomorphy of Kistecephalia (postcranial data is deficient
for other kistecephalians, however). A supinator process
is present in almost all cryptodonts for which postcranial
data is available, being present in Rhachiocephalus,
Oudenodon, Aulacephalodon, and Odontocyclops, but not
116

Australobarbarus. Among dicynodontoids, it is absent in all
non-kannemeyeriiforms for which humeri are known.
Among kannemeyeriiforms with preserved humeri, it is
only absent in Dinodontosaurus.
174. Morphology of supinator process: 0, low, broadly
separated from the shaft; 1, tall and subvertical, with
dorsal margin close to base of shaft; 2, discrete, tab-like
process occupying restricted portion of anterior face of
distal humerus.
In most dicynodonts, the supinator process is a relatively small, low structure proximal to the ectepicondyle
but still widely separated from the humeral shaft. In
Pentasaurus, Placerias and Zambiasaurus (as well as the unnamed Polish dicynodont [Dzik et al. 2008], which is not
included in the current analysis) the supinator process is a
tall, subvertical ridge extending across nearly the entire
edge of the ectepicondyle (Fig. 14A–C). By contrast, in
Eubrachiosaurus, Ischigualastia, and Stahleckeria, the
supinator process is much more limited in extent and
distinct from the ectepicondyle (Fig. 14D; see also
Kammerer et al. 2013), forming a tab-like structure prominently sticking off of the anterior edge of the humerus
(similar to the condition in many early synapsids, e.g.
Dimetrodon, but unlike any other dicynodonts; Romer
1956). Intriguingly, a somewhat intermediate condition is
present in Angonisaurus, a taxon that has recently
(Angielczyk & Kammerer 2017; Angielczyk et al. in press)
been recovered immediately outside of the Placeriinae+
Stahleckeriinae split. Here, Angonisaurus is coded ‘1’, as in
placeriines, as its supinator process is subvertical, originates near the base of the humeral shaft, and does not
form as much of a distinctly protruding ‘tab’ as in
stahleckeriines. However, unlike in placeriines and more
similar to stahleckeriines, the supinator process in

Angonisaurus is restricted in extent, and does not extend
down to the base of the ectepicondyle. The kistecephalian
emydopoids Dicynodontoides, Cistecephalus, and Kawingasaurus have also been coded ‘1’ for this character; although
their supinator process is not likely to be homologous
with that of placeriines, in these taxa it is also subvertical
and originates close to the shaft.
Three most parsimonious trees of length 1143.551 were
recovered, differing only in the positions of Sangusaurus
parringtonii and Pentasaurus goggai. Sangusaurus is recovered either as the sister-taxon of Stahleckeria (in two of the
three trees) or the sister-taxon of the clade (Eubrachiosaurus+(Ischigualastia+Jachaleria)). Pentasaurus is recovered either as the sister-taxon of Zambiasaurus (in two of
the three trees) or Placerias.
The results of the new analysis (Fig. 21) are generally
similar to those of Angielczyk & Kammerer (2017), with a
few notable exceptions. Cryptodontia is again recovered
as monophyletic, as previously found by Kammerer et al.
(2011, 2013, 2016), Castanhinha et al. (2013), Angielczyk &
Cox (2015), Cox & Angielczyk (2015), and Kammerer &
ISSN 2410-4418 Palaeont. afr. (2018) 52: 102–128

Smith (2017), but unlike several recent analyses of
anomodont phylogeny (Boos et al., 2016; Angielczyk &
Kammerer, 2017; Angielczyk et al. in press). The composition of the cryptodont subclades largely corresponds to
that of Angielczyk & Kammerer (2017), with Geikiidae
containing Idelesaurus and Bulbasaurus in addition to the
geikiines and Oudenodontidae containing Oudenodon,
Australobarbarus, and Tropidostoma. Odontocyclops is recovered as a rhachiocephalid, a novel position for this taxon
(in the context of a cladistic analysis; the genus itself was
originally based on a species of Rhachiocephalus, R. dubius),
which has otherwise been recovered as an oudenodontid
(Kammerer & Smith 2017), a geikiid (Boos et al. 2016),
or outside of a geikiid+rhachiocephalid clade (e.g.
Kammerer et al. 2011).
As discussed by Angielczyk & Kammerer (2017), the
monophyly (or lack thereof) of Cryptodontia strongly
influences the topology of Dicynodontoidea. In analyses
where cryptodonts are recovered as monophyletic, the
‘elphids’ (Elph, Interpresosaurus, and Katumbia) generally
fall out as basal dicynodontoids (instead of basal

bidentalians), and the topology of the remaining Permian
dicynodontoids is relatively pectinate. Both of these
results are present in the current analysis, at least as
regards the Permian dicynodontoids outside of the
Lystrosauridae+Kannemeyeriiformes split. Lystrosauridae is expansive in the current analysis, however, and
includes the former ‘Dicynodon’ (sensu lato) species
Euptychognathus bathyrhynchus, Gordonia traquairi,
Jimusaria sinkianensis, Sintocephalus alticeps, and Syops
vanhoepeni in addition to Lystrosaurus itself. With the
exception of Gordonia, all of these taxa have previously
been recovered as lystrosaurids (Kammerer et al. 2011),

albeit with very low support. Angielczyk & Kammerer
(2017) recovered an unusual position for Lystrosauridae
(restricted to Lystrosaurus in that analysis) at the base of
Dicynodontoidea. Lystrosauridae is here recovered as the
sister-group of Kannemeyeriiformes, as in most other
analyses of anomodont phylogeny (e.g. Kammerer et al.
2011, 2013; Castanhinha et al. 2013; Cox & Angielczyk
2015; Kammerer & Smith 2017). In general, the relationships among non-kannemeyeriiform dicynodontoids
remain extremely volatile, as indicated by the constant
flux in dicynodontoid topology between subsequent
analyses.

Within Kannemeyeriiformes, the results of the current
analysis are extremely similar to those of Angielczyk &
Kammerer (2017), including the troublesome nonmonophyly of Shansiodontidae (traditionally composed
of Shansiodon, Rhinodicynodon, Tetragonias, and Vinceria,

which here form a grade at the base of Kannemeyeriiformes). It is likely that this issue is related to the mosaic of
shansiodontid-like and stahleckeriid-like characters
present in Dinodontosaurus, which is recovered here as
more closely related to stahleckeriids than shansiodontids. Further research on Dinodontosaurus, which is known
from abundant material in the Brazilian Santa Maria
Formation (Langer et al. 2007) and less abundant but
generally better-preserved material in the Argentine
Chañares Formation (Mancuso et al. 2014), is required to
help resolve this issue. The only difference between the
current analysis and that of Angielczyk & Kammerer
(2017) is the addition of Pentasaurus, which destabilizes
relationships within Placeriinae. This can probably be
attributed to missing data: because of the highly incomplete nature of the known material, Pentasaurus could
only be coded for a small fraction of the characters in the
phylogenetic analysis (22/197).

Identification of the Pentasaurus material and its

of its taxonomic unity and distinction from other Triassic
dicynodonts is warranted. As there are no repeated
elements among the Pentasaurus specimens and available
evidence indicates that they were found at the same
locality, it is tempting to suspect that they represent a
single individual. Unfortunately, the limited collection
data for these specimens makes it impossible to be certain
whether they were found in association. Furthermore,
given that Brown’s collections from Barnard’s Spruit also
include definite sauropodomorph and probable ‘rauisuchian’ specimens, the possibility that other isolated
elements from this lot pertain to archosaurs must be carefully considered. None of the elements here referred to
Pentasaurus resemble ‘rauisuchian’ bones. The tibia and
potential radius fragments (Figs 17, 18) are large and
120

poorly-preserved enough to be mistaken for sauropodomorph elements, but they do not match the histological
profile for dinosaurs (see above). Most of the other
elements are unmistakably dicynodontian. The fused
dentary symphysis forming a toothless ‘beak’, prominent
lateral dentary shelf, and dentary table of NHMW
1876-VII-B-114 allow this specimen to be definitively
identified as a dicynodont. The humerus NHMW
1876-VII-B-123 also exhibits an array of features present in
therapsids but not sauropodomorphs or ‘rauisuchians’
(e.g. anteroposteriorly broad distal portion, large,
well-defined areas for the capitulum and trochlea, large
entepicondylar foramen). Furthermore, both of these
elements exhibit features specific to placeriine stahleckeriids among dicynodonts: the combination of a huge

splenial contribution to the jaw symphysis and median
symphysial ridge in the jaw fragment and the presence
of an elongate, subvertical supinator process on the
humerus. The other referred elements all exhibit characteristic dicynodont morphologies, albeit not specific
placeriine synapomorphies (see Description above).
The placeriine synapomorphies in the Pentasaurus jaw
and humerus elements allow ready differentiation from
the majority of Triassic dicynodonts. Importantly,
mandibular morphology clearly distinguishes NHMW
1876-VII-B-114 from the most common taxon of Karoo
kannemeyeriiform, Kannemeyeria simocephalus (see Fig. 4).
Although survival of the probably Middle Triassic Kannemeyeria into the Elliot Formation would be unlikely, the
possibility had to be considered, given the possible
presence of Diademodon (which co-occurs with Kannemeyeria in the Burgersdorp Formation) in the lower Elliot
(Abdala et al. 2007) and general uncertainty as to the
Burgersdorp’s precise age (Ottone et al. 2014). The morphology of the distal humerus NHMW 1876-VII-B-123
permits distinction from stahleckeriines: both the proportions of the humerus and the shape and position of the
supinator process differ sharply from that of stahleckeriines (see Fig. 14). The mandibular fragment provides
additional characters indicating a non-stahleckeriine
identification. A median symphysial ridge, present in
NHMW 1876-VII-B-114, is absent in all known stahleckeriines (Kammerer pers. obs.) Additionally, the
symphysis in NHMW 1876-VII-B-114 is relatively tall and
steeply sloping (Fig. 20E). This is similar to the condition in
all other known placeriines (Fig. 20A,B,D), but differs
from the more elongate, horizontally-directed symphysis
in stahleckeriines (Fig. 20C). Other placeriines also differ
from stahleckeriines in that the tip of the ‘beak’ is shorter
by comparison; unfortunately the tip is broken off in
NHMW 1876-VII-B-114 so it is unknown whether this
feature was shared as well.
Among placeriines, the mandibular morphology of
NHMW 1876-VII-B-114 clearly differs from that of
Placerias, as detailed in the Description above. The same
points of distinction largely also apply to Moghreberia,
although poor preservation of the mandible in that taxon
(Fig. 20A) complicates comparisons for certain characters (notably the presence of a sharp edge between the
anterior and lateral faces of the symphysis, which is
present in in Placerias, absent in Pentasaurus, and probably
present in Moghreberia, although this surface is poorly
preserved). The most important taxon for comparison in
establishing the taxonomic distinctness of the lower Elliot
dicynodont material is Zambiasaurus submersus from the
upper Ntawere Formation of Zambia. As the only other
southern African placeriine this taxon is geographically
proximate; furthermore, the age of the Ntawere Formation is poorly-constrained and could potentially overlap with the lower Elliot (although it is likely to be
older; Angielczyk et al. 2014). Regrettably, Zambiasaurus
is known largely from isolated, juvenile remains
(Angielczyk et al. 2014), complicating comparisons with
the large, presumed subadult-to-adult elements of
Pentasaurus. With this said, there are a few firm bases for
ISSN 2410-4418 Palaeont. afr. (2018) 52: 102–128

comparison. For one thing, the position and morphology
of the lateral dentary shelf is not known to be an ontogenetically variable feature in dicynodonts (Angielczyk
et al. 2009; Maisch 2009). Although known dentary elements in Zambiasaurus are small and poorly preserved
(e.g. Fig. 20D), none show any trace of the robust, anteriorly located lateral dentary shelf here considered autapomorphic for Pentasaurus. Additionally, one distal
humerus fragment of Zambiasaurus (NHMUK R9140;
Figs 14C, 15C) is substantially larger than the other known
Zambiasaurus limb elements and is comparable in size
to the Pentasaurus humerus NHMW 1876-VII-B-123
(Figs 14A, 15A). Although similar in overall shape, in
Pentasaurus the distal surface of the humerus is substantially more robust and dorsoventrally expanded than in
Zambiasaurus. Also, the morphology of the entepicondyle
differs between these specimens, being relatively truncated in Pentasaurus. Although this distinction may be
exaggerated by damage to NHMW 1876-VII-B-123, worn
bone surface is unlikely to explain all the variation seen
between Figures 15A and C. Thus, despite less-than-ideal
sets of overlapping material for both taxa, available points
of comparison support taxonomic separation between
Pentasaurus and Zambiasaurus.
Identification of the Pentasauropus trackmaker
In a series of contributions, Ellenberger (1955, 1970, 1972,
1974) described a diverse ichnofossil assemblage from
Stormberg exposures in Lesotho. The majority of
Ellenberger ’s lower Elliot ichnotaxa correspond to
reptilian trackmakers (Olsen & Galton 1984), as expected
of a Late Triassic tetrapod assemblage, but there are
some probable exceptions. One of the most unusual and
intriguing of Ellenberger’s track morphotypes is a large,
pentadactyl print currently known as Pentasauropus
incredibilis (Ellenberger’s ichnotaxonomy, encompassing
over 60 ichnogenera and 150 ichnospecies, is generally
regarded as highly oversplit, and five ichnospecies are
currently considered synonymous with P. incredibilis;
D’Orazi Porchetti & Nicosia 2007). The zoological attribution of the Pentasauropus tracks has long proven problematic. Ellenberger & Ellenberger (1958) initially identified
the trackmaker of Pentasauropus as either a ‘Theromorphe’
(=synapsid) or an amphibian. Later, Ellenberger (1970)
cited personal correspondence with Donald Baird and
A. W. Crompton, who identified the trackmaker as a large
dicynodont. Later contributions (e.g. Ellenberger 1972)
favored reptilian identification, with a large ‘anapsid’
reptile or sauropod dinosaur proposed as potential trackmakers. Early revisers of this ichnofossil assemblage were
similarly circumspect: Haubold (1974) considered the
trackmaker of Pentasauropus to be either a sauropod or an
anomodont. Subsequent research has generally favoured
a dicynodont identification for the Pentasauropus trackmaker, however (e.g. Demathieu & Haubold 1974;
Hopson 1984; Olsen & Galton 1984; Anderson et al. 1998;
Lockley & Meyer 2000; Gaston et al. 2003; Lockley et al.
2006). Olsen & Galton (1984, p. 97) called these tracks
‘unmistakable’ despite their poor preservation, and flatly
stated that dicynodonts represent the ‘only early Meso121

zoic… group with feet both large enough and with toes
short enough to have made Pentasauropus-type tracks’.
Despite majority support for the ‘Pentasauropus as
dicynodont track’ hypothesis, in recent years there have
been a few dissenting opinions. Knoll (2004) deemed the
dicynodont affinities of Pentasauropus unconvincing and
argued that it could also be sauropodan. Hunt & Lucas
(2007) stated that while only dicynodonts represent a
good match for the Pentasauropus prints morphologically,
they doubted this attribution based on the absence of
skeletal evidence for dicynodonts of equivalent age to the
tracks (speaking specifically of North American records
[Lockley & Hunt 1995], but applicable to the southern
African record as well).
The most recent revisionary work on the Lesotho
trackways (D’Orazi Porchetti & Nicosia 2007) has convincingly demonstrated that the Pentasauropus tracks do not
match sauropodomorph autopodia. Many of the tracks
from the Stormberg of Lesotho (e.g. Tetrasauropus and
Pseudotetrasauropus) do show indications of a sauropodomorph trackmaker and differ dramatically from those of
Pentasauropus. As regards Hunt & Lucas’ (2007) issue that
dicynodonts must have gone extinct prior to the Pentasauropus tracks being laid down, several lines of evidence
now address this problem. Firstly, although precise
chronostratigraphic dating remains elusive for many
Triassic vertebrate assemblages worldwide, there is
increasingly good evidence that a number of stahleckeriid
dicynodont-bearing deposits are actually Norian in age
(Irmis et al. 2011; Kent et al. 2014; note also that Dzik et al.
[2008] even proposed a Rhaetian age for Polish stahlec122

keriid remains). So arguments based on a prior understanding of dicynodonts having gone extinct at the end of
the Carnian (e.g. Benton 2006) are no longer tenable.
Secondly, concerning the southern African record in
particular, it is true that historically there has been no
skeletal evidence for dicynodonts surviving in the Karoo
Basin above the (probably) Middle Triassic Burgersdorp
Formation. As the Elliot Formation is reasonably wellsampled (Smith et al. 2012), this seemed to be good
evidence that dicynodonts truly were absent there in the
Late Triassic. However, raw sampling is often not equivalent to subsequent worker research effort, and researchers
working in collections frequently overlook specimens that
do not fit the search image for their taxon of interest. This
can make the absence of certain taxa in even well-sampled
deposits something of a ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’: if
researchers do not expect to find a given taxon, they may
not look for it, and specialists on that taxon will eschew
collections that (supposedly) contain no representatives
of it. As clear evidence of this, the specimens described
herein were housed in one of the largest and most
frequently visited palaeontological collections in Europe
for over 140 years without any recognition of their taxonomic identification and importance. It is possible that
additional dicynodont elements remain unrecognized in
other lower Elliot collections.
Given that the Pentasauropus incredibilis tracks from
the lower Elliot Formation morphologically match a
dicynodont trackmaker, and that dicynodonts were
indeed present in this formation (based on the newlydescribed fossils herein), can it be demonstrated that the

taxon here named Pentasaurus was actually the trackmaker of Pentasauropus? On a strict morphology basis, the
answer is no. No manus or pes elements are preserved
among the known material of Pentasaurus, so direct
comparisons are not possible. Furthermore, known
kannemeyeriiform manual and pedal materials are
ISSN 2410-4418 Palaeont. afr. (2018) 52: 102–128

generally homomorphic, suggesting morphological
conservatism of these elements across the clade.
Observed variation in manus morphology among kannemeyeriiforms has mostly been limited to minor differences in ungual shape (Cox 1965; Lucas 2002); it is
uncertain to what degree, if any, this would be reflected
123

in Pentasauropus-type trackways. As such, even if Pentasaurus autopodia were known, unique correspondence
with the Pentasauropus incredibilis tracks would be unlikely. Indeed, tracks referred to Pentasauropus have also
been reported from North (Lockley & Hunt 1995; Gaston
et al. 2003) and South America (Domnanovich et al. 2008);
these tracks likely represent various local kannemeyeriiform taxa (Placerias, Ischigualastia, etc.) However,
while a morphological correlation between Pentasaurus
goggai and Pentasauropus incredibilis is not currently possible (and may never be), a strong circumstantial case can be
made for Pentasaurus as the trackmaker of lower Elliot
Pentasauropus prints. Although dicynodonts are now
thought to have survived into the Norian, they were rare
and species-poor at this time. No Norian basins are
known to produce more than a single dicynodont species.
Kammerer et al. (2013) recently resurrected Eubrachiosaurus browni from the Popo Agie Formation of Wyoming
as a valid taxon, bringing the number of Triassic North
American dicynodont species to two (the other being the
well-known Placerias hesternus). However, no localities are
known to produce both Eubrachiosaurus and Placerias, and
increasing evidence indicates that the tetrapod fauna
of the Popo Agie Formation is not coeval with the
Placerias-bearing beds of the Chinle Formation, instead
representing a substantially older (potentially Carnian)
assemblage (Hartman et al. 2015). In South America, one
endemic species each is known from the Los Colorados
Formation of Argentina (Jachaleria colorata) and the
Caturrita Formation of Brazil (Jachaleria candelariensis)
(Arcucci et al. 2004; Müller et al. 2015). It is highly unlikely
that the lower Elliot Formation would have diverged from
this pattern, particularly given the rarity of dicynodont
fossils in this formation relative to other Norian deposits
(while additional Pentasaurus remains may well be lying
unrecognized in South African collections, its record is
clearly poorer than the likes of Placerias and Jachaleria,
which are known from multiple skulls). In conclusion,
there is no good reason to suspect any dicynodont taxa
other than Pentasaurus goggai were present in the lower
Elliot Formation, making it the only probable trackmaker
of regional Pentasauropus trackways.
Biogeographic and faunal implications
The recognition of a placeriine dicynodont in the lower
Elliot Formation conflicts with several prevailing ideas on
Late Triassic dicynodont survival, namely their supposed
absence in the Karoo Basin in strata above the Burgersdorp Formation (Rubidge 1995), the supposed disjunct
between Triassic faunas containing dicynodonts vs
sauropodomorph dinosaurs as the largest-bodied herbivores (Benton 1994), and the recognition of Placeriinae as
a predominantly Northern Hemisphere clade (Kammerer
et al. 2013, in press).
The lack of co-occurrence between large-bodied kannemeyeriiform dicynodonts and the earliest large dinosaurian herbivores (sauropodomorphs) has frequently been
discussed by Triassic researchers in the context of
synapsid/archosaur turnover patterns (Bakker 1977;
Benton 1983, 2006; Charig 1984; Zawiskie 1986; Brusatte
124

et al. 2008; Benton et al. 2014). The prevailing idea in the
late 20th and early 21st centuries was that dicynodonts
went extinct at the end of the Carnian, whereas the first
large-bodied sauropodomorphs did not appear until the
Norian (Benton 1994). Thus, direct ecological interaction between dicynodonts and sauropodomorphs was
thought not to have occurred, regardless of whether the
researchers in question supported environmental change
(e.g. Benton 1983) or clade-level competition with
archosaurs (e.g. Charig 1984) as the primary driver of
Triassic synapsid decline. As discussed in the preceding
section, new radioisotopic and magnetostratigraphic
dates for Late Triassic vertebrate assemblages now indicate that dicynodonts survived into the Norian (Irmis et al.
2011; Kent et al. 2014). However, even with this extension
of the clade’s range, there has until now been no evidence
of direct co-occurrence between dicynodonts and largebodied sauropodomorphs. The youngest dicynodont
remains from South America (and the youngest securely
dated dicynodonts worldwide) are those of Jachaleria
colorata from the Norian Los Colorados Formation of
Argentina (Kent et al. 2014). The Los Colorados Formation
also contains a diverse sauropodomorph assemblage
including the taxa Coloradisaurus, Riojasaurus, and the
enormous (~9 m) Lessemsaurus (Pol & Powell 2007). However, these taxa are known only from the upper part of
the formation, whereas Jachaleria is known only from
the base of the formation (Arcucci et al. 2004). Disarticulated archosaur specimens that may represent sauropodomorphs have been recovered from the basal Los
Colorados, in the same levels as Jachaleria, but they are
currently undescribed (Martínez et al. 1998). The preliminarily-described kannemeyeriiform from the Lisowice
claypit in Poland was originally stated to be Rhaetian
(Dzik et al. 2008), but this site may also be Norian
(Niedïwiedzki & Sulej 2008), and regardless of age has
not produced any sauropodomorph material. Thus, the
presence of Pentasaurus and Eucnemesaurus in the material
from Barnard’s Spruit potentially represents the first
co-occurrence of a dicynodont and large sauropodomorph in the Triassic.
Kammerer et al. (2013, in press) commented on the
global distribution of stahleckeriids, noting an apparent
geographic disjunct between its two subclades, with
stahleckeriine fossils mostly found in the Southern Hemisphere and placeriine fossils mostly in the Northern. They
recognized exceptions to this pattern, however, with
the stahleckeriine Eubrachiosaurus browni known from
the Popo Agie Formation of the western United States
(Wyoming) and the placeriine Zambiasaurus submersus
known from the Ntawere Formation of Zambia. Pentasaurus goggai represents an additional exception to this
supposed pattern, joining Zambiasaurus among the ranks
of southern Gondwanan placeriines. Furthermore, it
refutes the hypothesis that while placeriines may have
originated in Gondwana in the Middle Triassic, their Late
Triassic radiation was confined to the Northern Hemisphere. The presence of Pentasaurus in the lower Elliot
demonstrates that this clade was present across Pangaea
even in the Late Triassic.

Environmental restriction offers a common explanation
for the conflicts between the three aforementioned
prevailing ideas on Triassic dicynodont distribution and
the presence of Pentasaurus in the lower Elliot Formation.
Late Triassic dicynodont fossils show a distinctly ‘patchy’
distribution, best illustrated by Placerias hesternus. This
taxon is generally one of the rarest components of North
American Triassic assemblages, but in a few exceptional
localities represents the dominant taxon (most notably the
Placerias Quarry near St. Johns, Arizona; Lucas & Heckert
2002). Massive accumulations like the Placerias Quarry
indicate that P. hesternus was not just a rare, solitary
animal, but more likely was an ecologically-restricted
taxon that did not prefer or could not tolerate the seasonally arid environments preserving most Chinle Formation
tetrapod fossils. Notably, the Blue Mesa Member of the
Chinle Formation, which has produced the majority of
Placerias fossils, seems to preserve one of the wettest
sections of the Chinle (Martz & Parker 2010). Additionally,
although only preliminarily studied, Placerias seems to be
more abundant in the more humid basins of the Newark
Supergroup in eastern North America (Baird & Patterson
1968; Kammerer et al. 2013). This would concord with
broader-scale studies indicating the restriction of
synapsids to humid belts in the Late Triassic (Whiteside
et al. 2011). Thus, synapsids could still have been
extremely abundant in ‘patches’ of the appropriate habitat in the Late Triassic, but if that specific habitat is not preserved, they would appear to be absent in the regional
record. Although less arid than the upper Elliot (with
perennial river systems; Bordy & Eriksson 2015), the
lower Elliot still represents a relatively arid environment
compared to earlier Triassic dicynodont-bearing deposits
(e.g. Smith & Swart 2002), and it is likely that the majority
of fossiliferous localities in the lower Elliot simply do not
preserve the sort of wet habitat frequented by Late Triassic
dicynodonts. As such, the co-occurrence of a kannemeyeriiform and large sauropodomorph like Pentasaurus
and Eucnemesaurus may represent an unusual circumstance, and these taxa may well have rarely encountered
each other when alive, because of their preferences for
different kinds of vegetation (see Benton 1983; Crompton
& Attridge 1986).
The apparent geographic disjunct between placeriine
and stahleckeriine stahleckeriids in the Carnian-Norian is
more difficult to explain, but is also probably attributable
to environmental specializations of the respective clades.
Work on functional variation in the dicynodont feeding
apparatus has generally focused on very broad trends,
such as the differences between Permian and Triassic
dicynodonts (e.g. Crompton & Hotton 1967). Unfortunately, little attention has been given to the functional
implications of differences in morphology within Kannemeyeriiformes. Surkov & Benton (2008) attempted to
reconstruct feeding height in dicynodonts and preferred
plane of head movement based on occipital morphology
and included a number of Triassic taxa in their analysis.
They measured differences in the relative height and
width of the occiput, which they took to reflect differences
in relative efficiency of the lateral and dorsal portions of
ISSN 2410-4418 Palaeont. afr. (2018) 52: 102–128

the neck musculature. Dicynodonts with heads low to the
ground would be expected to use more lateral movements, whereas dicynodonts feeding high would require
greater development of the dorsal neck musculature to
hold the head up. Under this scheme, Surkov & Benton
(2008) reconstructed Placerias as a high-level feeder and
Stahleckeria as a low-level feeder. While these results
suggest that general cranial conservatism belies sharp
differences in feeding behavior between kannemeyeriiform taxa, occipital dimensions are only part of the story:
other trophically relevant morphological features of these
taxa still await detailed comparisons. As shown by
Angielczyk et al. (in press), position and angulation of jaw
muscles would also have strongly influenced dicynodont
feeding style, but rigorous reconstructions are currently
available for only a small handful of taxa. Mandibular
morphology is also understudied, and the functional
implications of differences in dicynodont jaw shape
are poorly known. The narrower, taller symphyses of
placeriines (Figs 5, 20) do suggest that they were concentrating greater bite force on the ‘beak’ tip than
stahleckeriines, possibly reflecting differences in preferred diet (as suggested by Cox [1965] for kannemeyeriids vs stahleckeriids). Observed distribution of the
two stahleckeriid subclades, then, may just be reflective
of local abundance of preferred vegetation, with apparent rarity in one hemisphere or another representing
sampling artefact. However, the situation is complex:
despite the similarity of their mandibular morphology
and inferred myology to Stahleckeria, other stahleckeriines
(Ischigualastia and Jachaleria) were reconstructed by
Surkov & Benton (2008) as high-feeders, with similar
occipital values to Placerias. So it is probably premature to
propose general, clade-specific feeding specializations for
placeriines vs stahleckeriines that explain their distribution. Extensive additional research will be required to
incorporate these various sources of data into a holistic
view of kannemeyeriiform feeding, and as Pentasaurus
indicates, there remains much left to learn about the
palaeobiology of the latest-surviving dicynodonts.

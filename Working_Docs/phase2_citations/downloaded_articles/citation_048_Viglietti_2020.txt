Abstract
The end-Permian mass extinction (EPME) is widely recognized as the largest mass extinction
in Phanerozoic history. In marine strata the main extinction event is well constrained, and has
been radiometrically-dated to an interval of some 60 kyr, approximately 251.9 million years
ago. However, the age and duration of the EPME in the terrestrial realm, as well as its
possible synchronicity with that of the marine realm, is debated. Here, we shed light on issues
pertaining to the identification and position of the terrestrial EPME in southern Africa. Using

of

recently collected sedimentological (facies sequences), palaeontological (biostratigraphic

ro

ranges), geochemical (stable isotope analyses) and detrital zircon (ID-TIMS) data from a new

-p

site in the Xhariep District of the South African Karoo Basin, we demonstrate that the

re

Permian-Triassic boundary sequence containing evidence for phased tetrapod extinctions is
time equivalent with the marine extinction. We conclude that the terrestrial EPME recorded

lP

in the Karoo may be regarded as essentially synchronous with the EPME currently defined in

na

the marine realm, and was likely the result of the same volcanically-induced atmospheric
disturbances. This study describes the first single, vertical succession of vertebrate and plant

Jo
ur

fossils that span the terrestrial Permian-Triassic boundary that are also well-constrained both
by relative (stable isotopes) and absolute (detrital zircon geochronology) dating methods.

1. Introduction

1.1 The end-Permian mass extinction
The end-Permian mass extinction (EPME) was the most devastating ecological crisis
in Phanerozoic history. Its effect on both marine and terrestrial ecosystems substantially
changed community structure causing a severe reduction in global biodiversity (Xie et al.,
2005; Yin et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2011; Smith and Botha-Brink 2014).

of

Recent geochronological evidence constrains the event to between 251.941 ± 0.037 and

ro

251.880 ± 0.031 million years ago (Ma) using U-Pb dated zircons from ash beds sampled in

-p

the marine Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) at Meishan, South China

re

(Burgess et al., 2014). Although many causes for the extinction have been proposed, there is
broad consensus that ecosystem collapse was catalyzed by emission of greenhouse gases

lP

during prolonged volcanic eruption and subsequent sill intrusions in northern Pangaea, as

na

evidenced by the extensive Siberian Traps flood basalts (Renne et al., 1995; Payne and
Kump, 2007; Grasby et al., 2011; Black et al., 2012; Burgess et al., 2017). The proposed

Jo
ur

effects of this volcanogenic gas and dust pollution on the marine realm include benthic
acidification, anoxia, hypercapnia, euxinia, and excessive methane release from deep sea gas
hydrates, leading to a rapid decline in biodiversity (Alroy, 2008; Wignall et al., 2010;
Brennecka et al., 2011; Loope and Kump, 2013; Foster and Twitchett, 2014; Lau et al.,
2016). In the continental realm in Gondwana, increasingly warmer and drier climatic
conditions along with considerably less reliable rainfall triggered a similar large-magnitude
reduction in primary productivity and terrestrial biodiversity in general (Smith and BothaBrink, 2014; Rey et al., 2016; MacLeod et al., 2017). These conditions have been argued to
have resulted in unstable communities and heightened extinction risks for the survivors for at

Journal Pre-proof
least five million years after the event, based on trophic network models (Roopnarine et al.,
2007, 2019; Roopnarine and Angielczyk, 2015).

1.2 Rationale for the present study
South Africa’s Karoo Basin has provided the most complete record of the effect of the
terrestrial EPME, and numerous field investigations have yielded precise biostratigraphic
records of Karoo tetrapods throughout the uppermost Permian to lowermost Triassic (e.g.

of

Smith, 1995; Smith and Ward, 2001; Hancox et al., 2002; Retallack et al., 2003; Smith and

ro

Botha, 2005; Botha and Smith, 2006; Smith and Botha-Brink, 2014; Viglietti et al., 2018a).

-p

By integrating sedimentological, biostratigraphic, palaeomagnetic and geochemical data,

re

these studies have led to the identification of a relatively continuous PTB interval in the
Karoo Basin. The interval is characterised by a basin-wide sequence of sedimentary facies

lP

associations that indicate progressive lowering of regional groundwater, increased

Viglietti et al., 2018a).

na

seasonality, and climate drying (Smith and Botha-Brink, 2014; MacLeod et al., 2017;

Jo
ur

The PTB sequence coincides with a three-phased extinction of tetrapods and the
apparent disappearance of glossopterid-dominated floras (Smith and Botha Brink, 2014).
Within the lower Palingkloof Member, an interval of laminated reddish-brown and olive-grey
siltstone-mudstone couplets has been used as a marker for the main extinction pulse. This is
associated with the basin-wide last appearance of the Permian dicynodonts Daptocephalus
leoniceps, Dicynodontoides recurvidens, Dinanomodon rubidgei and Lystrosaurus maccaigi.
The overlying massive siltstone facies of the upper Palingkloof Member marks the first
appearance of the archosauriform Proterosuchus fergusi, Lystrosaurus declivis and L.
murrayi (Smith and Botha-Brink, 2014). This sequence records substantial turnover and
alterations to community structure and resilience (Roopnarine and Angielczyk, 2012, 2015,

Journal Pre-proof
2016; Roopnarine et al., 2007, 2019), while also preserving the distinctive geochemical
signatures of the PTB. The latter include a negative δ13C excursion (MacLeod et al., 2000;
Ward et al., 2005) in addition to other chemostratigraphic and radiometric age constraints
(Coney et al., 2007).
Nevertheless, a few recent studies have disputed the placement of the
biostratigraphically-defined PTB in South Africa (Steiner et al., 2003, Gastaldo et al., 2009,
2015, 2019), calling into question the synchronicity of intrabasinal faunal turnover (Gastaldo

of

et al., 2015), as well as the evidence for basin-wide aridification in the earliest Triassic

ro

(Tabor et al., 2007, Gastaldo et al., 2014, 2017). Consequently, these studies have catalyzed a

-p

reinvestigation of the timing of the main extinction event and its correlation to that of the

re

marine realm (Gastaldo et al., 2015), an effort that has been aided by new geochronologic age
constraints including radiometric dates presented here by our team. Here, we present new

lP

sedimentological, biostratigraphic, and geochemical data, including radiometric dates from

na

detrital zircons, collected from a recently recognised terrestrial PTB site in the main Karoo
Basin. Our multidisciplinary study evaluated the accuracy of the widely accepted position of

Jo
ur

the EPME in the main Karoo Basin, and contributes to the debate about its synchronicity with
the marine EPME.

2. Historical context

Until the turn of the century, most research on the EPME focused on marine strata
(Jin et al., 2000), whereas complete terrestrial Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) sequences
were considered to be rare or absent within continental basins. More recently, however,
relatively continuous terrestrial PTB sections have been investigated in South Africa, Russia,
Antarctica, Australia and China, allowing researchers to examine the timing and mechanisms

Journal Pre-proof
of terrestrial extinctions using multi-proxy approaches (e.g. Ward et al., 2000; Smith and
Ward, 2001; Benton et al., 2004; Retallack et al., 2005; Collinson et al., 2006; Metcalfe et al.,
2009, 2015; Cui et al., 2017; Fielding et al., 2019). Consequently, several techniques have
been used to identify sedimentological and geochemical signatures of the mass extinction, in
addition to the floral and faunal turnovers that are apparent across the PTB. Sedimentological
studies have revealed changes in fluvial style and modification of floodplain environments
across the PTB in Antarctica (Webb and Fielding, 1993; Collinson et al., 2006), South Africa

of

(Smith, 1995; Ward et al., 2000; Smith and Botha-Brink, 2014), Spain (Arche and López-

ro

Gómez, 2005), Russia (Newell et al., 1999), China (Metcalfe et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2010;

-p

Zhang et al., 2016) and some parts of Australia (Retallack et al., 1998; Michaelsen, 2002; but

re

see Fielding et al., 2019). These generally manifest as a change from high-sinuosity,
meandering river systems with expansive, wet floodplains through a straightening transition

lP

stage to low-sinuosity, braided ephemeral river channels with seasonally dry floodplains

na

subject to flash floods (Ward et al., 2000; Smith and Botha-Brink, 2014).
Associated with these large-scale environmental changes, a distinctive

Jo
ur

chemostratigraphic signature, represented by a steep negative δ13C excursion at the PTB, has
been observed at sites in South Africa (MacLeod et al., 2000, 2017; Ward et al., 2005; Coney
et al., 2007), Antarctica (Retallack et al., 2005) and China (Cao et al., 2008; Thomas et al.,
2011; Cui et al., 2017), mirroring that preserved in marine sediments (Korte and Kozur,
2010). Investigations of δ13C excursions in combination with precise zircon ages from
multiple ash beds at the GSSP at Meishan have allowed precise dating of this geochemical
signature (Shen et al., 2011, 2012, 2013), tying it to similar chemostratigraphic records in the
terrestrial Karoo Basin of South Africa (MacLeod et al., 2000; Ward et al., 2005; Coney et
al., 2007) as well as to the famous Siberian Traps (Burgess et al., 2014, 2017). Ongoing
studies have shown that excursions recorded in terrestrial sediments, such as those in the

Journal Pre-proof
Permo-Triassic Palingkloof Member (Balfour Formation) of the Karoo Basin, mark the
beginning of a series of δ13C excursions that occurred throughout much of the Early Triassic.
Importantly, they provide evidence for prolonged carbon cycle fluctuations indicating
extreme climate perturbations and environmental stress (Retallack et al. 2005, Payne et al.,
2004; Payne and Kump, 2007; Clarkson et al., 2013; Sanson-Barrera et al., 2015).
Although the magnitude and timing of resulting extinctions has been studied
extensively in marine sections (Erwin et al., 2002; Foster and Twitchett, 2014; Zaton et al.,

of

2016), the extent and rate of biodiversity loss in the terrestrial realm are still debated.

ro

Terrestrial vertebrate fossil assemblages spanning the PTB reveal a complex scenario of

-p

extinctions and reduced diversity in some clades, and increased abundance and diversity in

re

others (Benton et al., 2004; Irmis and Whiteside, 2011; Irmis et al., 2013; Fröbisch, 2013;
Smith and Botha-Brink, 2014). For example, temnospondyl amphibians, procolophonid

lP

parareptiles, archosauromorph reptiles and cynodont therapsids continued to diversify after

na

the extinction event (in the Induan stage), becoming key players in Triassic ecosystems (Ruta
and Benton, 2008; Nesbitt et al., 2013; Ruta et al., 2013a; MacDougall et al., 2019). By

Jo
ur

contrast, pareiasaurian parareptiles and gorgonopsian therapsids disappeared completely,
while the surviving therocephalian and dicynodont therapsids persisted with reduced diversity
and low rates of cladogenesis despite fairly strong abundances (Ruta et al., 2013b;
Huttenlocker et al., 2011; Huttenlocker, 2014; Smith and Botha-Brink, 2014). Most notable
among these is the disaster taxon Lystrosaurus, the most common tetrapod found in the
earliest Triassic of the Karoo Basin, South Africa, but also known from Triassic beds on
multiple continents such as the marine-to-terrestrial Panchet beds of India where its
connection to the marine Triassic was first established (Tripathi and Puri, 1961, 1962). With
the exceptions of L. maccaigi and L. curvatus, which have both been found in the latest
Permian, the other species of South African Lystrosaurus are exclusively Triassic in age

Journal Pre-proof
(Botha and Smith, 2006, 2007; Smith and Botha-Brink, 2014). As in therocephalians and
cynodonts (Huttenlocker, 2013; Huttenlocker and Botha-Brink, 2013, 2014), histologic and
taphonomic evidence show that Early Triassic Lystrosaurus exemplified a general pattern of
elevated early mortality and attenuated growth typical of most post-extinction therapsids
(Viglietti et al., 2013; Botha-Brink et al., 2016).
The effects of end-Permian extinctions on plants remain poorly understood. At a very
coarse resolution, the changes in Gondwanan floras from the late Permian to the Middle

of

Triassic are profound, where the distinctive Glossopteris-dominated forests of the Permian

ro

gave way to the much more diverse gymnosperm floras of the Middle-to-Late Triassic

-p

typified by the peltasperm Dicroidium (Anderson and Anderson, 1985; Retallack, 2005,

re

2013; Anderson et al., 2007; Lindström and McLoughlin, 2007). Some studies of macrofloral
and particularly palynological evidence indicate that the global PTB turnover was more of a

lP

transition than a mass die-off (Gastaldo et al, 2005; Lindström and McLoughlin, 2007;

na

Saxena et al., 2018; Fielding et al, 2019) or even that, at the generic level, the floras of the
world were minimally affected (Nowak et al., 2019). Fielding et al. (2019) even noted that

Jo
ur

the terrestrial turnover in Australia was asynchronous with the marine extinction.
Additionally, as more localities are studied it appears that key index taxa such as Glossopteris
and Dicroidium had overlapping ranges in some regions (Kerp et. al, 2006; Saxena et al,
2018). However, other authors have maintained that gymnosperm-dominated late Permian
floral communities experienced a devastating crisis during the EPME (McElwain and
Punyasena, 2007; Cascales-Miñana and Cleal, 2014; Yu et al., 2015; Cascales-Miñana et al.,
2016), and were in some regions succeeded by pioneering fern and lycopsid floras that
persisted into the early Middle Triassic (Retallack, 1995; Wang, 1996; Looy et al., 2001;
Grauvogel-Stamm and Ash, 2005). As suggested by Rees (2002), it is likely that plant
communities showed different patterns of extinction and recovery in different parts of the

Journal Pre-proof
world, and in the absence of high resolution studies of the changes in macrofloras across the
PTB, the pace and nature of this transition continues to be a source of debate (eg. Fielding et
al., 2019; Nowak et al., 2019). One of the greatest challenges facing palaeobotanists is the
rarity of earliest Triassic plant fossils (Gastaldo et al., 2005; Nowak et al., 2019). Increasing
global temperatures at the close of the Permian and into the Triassic, and the postulated
increase in aridification and seasonality (with accompanying fluctuations in water table) in
the interior regions of Pangaea, may provide a taphonomic explanation for this rarity. These

of

conditions would have decreased the preservation potential of fossil plants regionally and the

ro

likelihood of encountering those rare habitats that favoured plant preservation (Gastaldo,

-p

2005). These effects are certainly apparent in the Karoo Basin, where there is generally a

re

decline in plant fossil abundance and quality in the late Changhsingian, with the first wellpreserved floras and coal seams above the PTB only reappearing in the lower parts of the

lP

Upper Triassic (Anderson and Anderson, 1985; Anderson et al., 2007; Gastaldo et al., 2005).

na

While the fossil macrofloras of the upper Permian and Middle Triassic clearly represent
highly disparate plant communities, the pace and nature of the changes that took place over

Jo
ur

this interval remain poorly understood within the context of the Karoo Basin. Only through
continued and concerted efforts to find the sparse macroplant fossil evidence in the
uppermost Permian and lowermost Triassic strata, at multiple sites across the basin, will
progress be made towards reconstructing the floral changes that occurred in concert with the
patterns of extinction seen in the vertebrate faunas.

3. Study site and techniques

3.1. Field techniques

Journal Pre-proof
The field site extends over three adjoining farms (Nooitgedacht 68 [site locality
30°19’37.49”S 25°55’57.99”E], Vogelstruis-fontein 69, now called Droogefontein 176 [site
locality 30°20’22.08”S 25°55’45.39”E], and Geluksfontein 204 [site locality 30°20’28.03”S
25°55’46.7”E]) approximately 20 km north of the town Bethulie in the Xhariep Municipal
District (previously Bethulie District), Free State Province, South Africa (Fig. 1A, B).
Previously, Botha-Brink et al. (2014) described the sedimentary sequence and palaeontology
of PTB exposures on the farm Nooitgedacht 68, reporting a diverse assemblage dominated by

of

the end-Permian synapsid Lystrosaurus maccaigi. A subset of these specimens is presented in

ro

Table 1. The current study area includes two neighboring localities, namely an isolated flat-

-p

topped butte called ‘Loskop,’ and a pinnacle and adjacent ridge called ‘Spitskop’

re

approximately 800 m southwest of Loskop (Fig. 1C, D). Loskop is on the farm Nooitgedacht
68, whereas Spitskop extends over Nooitgedacht 68, Vogelstruis-fontein 69 and

lP

Geluksfontein 204 (Fig. 1B). Both localities contain an apparently complete sequence of

na

uppermost Permian and lowermost Triassic strata preserving the terrestrial PTB and its

zones (Fig. 2).

Jo
ur

associated faunal turnover from the upper Daptocephalus to lower Lystrosaurus assemblage

Initial stratigraphic logging by Botha-Brink et al. (2014) suggested that the two
prominences are equivalent in age, based on their lateral continuity over a short distance,
apparently continuous sedimentation, and similar vertical changes in the faunal assemblages
at both localities. In this study, a new stratigraphic section totaling 122 m was logged on
Spitskop from its lowermost exposures in the Balfour Formation to its summit in the middle
Katberg Formation. The logs were measured using standard field techniques, using a Jacob’s
staff and Abney level, to an accuracy of 10 cm. The lithology, rock colour (using Munsell
geological rock colour-chart 2009 revision), sedimentary structures, bedding planes, scour
surfaces, nodules, root traces, fossils and burrows were recorded onto each log (Fig. 3, Table

Journal Pre-proof
1, Supplementary Fig. S1, Supplementary Table S1). A list of in situ fossil taxa incorporating
all of the Bethulie (northern basin) and Graaff Reinet (southern basin) study sites to date is
presented in Supplementary Table S2.

3.2. Stable isotope geochemistry
In-situ carbonate nodules collected from Permian and Triassic palaeosols on both
Loskop (17 horizons) and Spitskop (12 horizons), were consumptively sampled for carbon

of

and oxygen stable isotope analysis (Fig. 3). Nodules were impact fractured and fresh surfaces

ro

milled for rock powder. Septarian nodules with visible crystalline structure in hand samples

-p

were excluded from the analysis. Diagenetic calcite veins were also sampled where possible

re

to control for diagenetic signatures. At least one nodule from each palaeosol profile was
milled, although multiple nodules were sampled closer to the palaeontologically-defined

lP

EPME in order to identify potential variability in the isotopic signatures. Enamel samples

na

were also taken from Permian theriodont therapsid teeth in order to compare their carbon and
oxygen isotope signatures with those of the pedogenic nodules.

Jo
ur

Micritic or finely-crystalline nodules and enamel samples were milled into a fine
powder using a Dremel tool with diamond-tipped bit, deposited onto a wax paper sheet, and
poured into small microcentrifuge tubes. For the theriodont enamel samples, only about one
milligram of sample was taken from two positions on either the mesial or lingual surfaces of
the teeth. Both basal and apical enamel samples were taken to account for variations in
isotopic signatures of individual teeth during their biomineralization.
Analyses were performed at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, USA. The sample
powders were weighed into silver capsules (approximately 50–100 micrograms of powder
per capsule) and dried under a vacuum at a temperature of 200°C approximately two hours
before analysis. The samples were analysed for δ13C and δ18O on a Finnigan MAT 252

Journal Pre-proof
coupled to a Carboflo dual-inlet carbonate device. The stable isotope ratios are reported as δ
values relative to the international standard Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (V-PDB), using the
standard per mil (‰) notation. SD of an internal carbonate standard was ± 0.1 ‰. For each
microcentrifuge tube of enamel powder, approximately 400 micrograms of sample were
weighed into silver capsules to ensure sufficient yield, and the above steps were followed
using an internal enamel standard. Carbonate standards used included Carrara Marble and
LCVEC lithium carbonate. Enamel standards included FGS (fossil gomphothere) and FRS

(fossil rhino). All standards have been calibrated to NBS 19.

A sandstone bed bearing volcaniclastics in the lower portion of the Spitskop section—
approximately 6.5 m below the palaeontologically-defined EPME and within facies B (lower

lP

Palingkloof Member) (Fig. 3)—was identified during our 2015 collecting trip and was found

na

to contain a high yield of detrital zircons. Hand samples were collected from unweathered
rock, stored in clean, plastic collecting bags, and transported to the laboratory where zircons

ur

were isolated using standard separation techniques. The samples yielded approximately 3.3
zircon crystals per cc. Up to 80 crystals were picked at random and mounted in epoxy,
polished, and imaged using SEM cathodoluminescence to visualize internal zoning and to
select ablation spots.

We first assessed age probabilities of zircon populations using laser ablation
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), and then estimated maximum
depositional age of the youngest zircons using high-precision isotope dilution thermal
ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS). Determination of age probabilities was first
conducted at the University of Utah LA-ICPMS laboratory, although age profiles from
additional beds were also assessed at the Central Analytical Facilities of Stellenbosch

Journal Pre-proof
University for comparison, following a subsequent collecting trip in 2017 (Supplementary
Information). Of the LA-ICPMS sample from facies B, 15 crystals from among the youngest
population were selected and analyzed at the Berkeley Geochronology Center using IDTIMS. Prior to ID-TIMS, the sample was abraded chemically and thermally annealed to
remove zones of potential Pb loss.

Jo

as follows:

some 35 km southeast of the study site. From the lowest (A) to the highest (E) the sequence is

4.1.1. Facies A–Massive greyish-brown mudrock
This facies (Fig. 3, Table 1, Supplementary Fig. S1, Table S1) comprises stacked 1 mthick tabular beds of blocky-weathering structureless greyish-brown (2.5Y/2) mudstone, and
rare erosionally-based, fine-grained sandstone bodies. The latter are generally light grey
(5Y7/1) on Loskop and more olive-grey (5Y4//2) on Spitskop. The sandstones range from 1-5
m thick and are structured by massive bedding at the base, grading and fining upwards into
ripple cross-laminated fine-grained sandstone stringers with irregular, low-angle (10–15°)
erosive bases that have previously been interpreted as lateral accretion units (Smith, 1987).
The massive greyish-brown muddy siltstone commonly hosts laterally continuous 1 m-thick

Journal Pre-proof
horizons containing scattered oblate smooth-surfaced brown-weathering nodules. The
nodules range from 5–20 cm in diameter and internally they commonly display small
brecciated mudrock clasts floating within a grey micritic siltstone matrix.
The interpreted depositional setting for the massive greyish-brown mudrock facies is
an expansive, generally dry, but seasonally wet, floodplain between meanderbelt ridges
comprising multi-lateral sand-dominated point bars (Jackson, 1981; Labrecque et al., 2011).
Floodwaters periodically overtopped, and in places broke through, the leveed channel banks,

of

inundating the floodplain. In the proximal floodplain areas the floods deposited thin layers of

ro

silt that were generally readily incorporated into the soil A horizon. However, some flood

-p

events resulted in much thicker deposits that effectively killed the soil profile and

re

simultaneously raised the water table. These events are preserved in the section as mottled
massive siltstones with horizons of oblate smooth-surfaced carbonate nodules containing

lP

brecciated mudrock, which are interpreted as having been precipitated subsurface in pond

na

margin environments on generally wet floodplains that are subjected to seasonal drying
(Alonso-Zarza, 2003). Near the base of the section (+/-1.5 m on Fig. 3A) a conspicuous

Jo
ur

horizon of vertically and horizontally-oriented calcareous rhizocretions is evidence of
fluctuating water tables in a lower part of a calcic palaeosol (Klappa, 1980). In summary, we
interpret the pedogenic mottling of the massive grey mudrock facies as evidence of gleyed
alluvium affected by a high watertable for most of the year with a short, warmer, dry season.
Within the seasonally fluctuating vadose zone of the floodplain alluvium, calcite was
precipitated around roots and clots of decaying plant matter resulting in the horizons of
carbonate rhizocretions and nodules.
An impression of a large tree branch was found approximately 24 m below the PTB
on Loskop (Fig. 3A; figured in Botha-Brink et al., 2014). Dicynodont therapsids identified as
Daptocephalus leoniceps (Fig. 5A) and Lystrosaurus maccaigi, which are index species of

Journal Pre-proof
the upper Permian Daptocephalus Assemblage Zone (AZ) (previously Dicynodon AZ see
Viglietti et al., 2016), were recovered from facies A around the base of Loskop and Spitskop.
Botha-Brink et al. (2014) previously assigned several dicynodont specimens to Dicynodon
lacerticeps based on the absence of nasal bosses and the presence of a narrow intertemporal
region and tusks, but the last two features apply to Daptocephalus leoniceps as well. Viglietti
et al. (2016) re-examined the stratigraphic placement of dicynodont specimens re-identified
in a recent study by Kammerer et al. (2011) and found that none of the Dicynodon specimens

were from the uppermost part of the biozone. As only Daptocephalus was found to extend to

4.1.2. Facies B–Massive mottled dark reddish-brown / olive-grey mudrock
This facies (Fig. 3, Table 1, Supplementary Fig. S1, Supplementary Table S1) on
Loskop and Spitskop comprises vertically stacked 0.25–5 m-thick tabular beds of mottled
dark reddish-brown (2.5YR 2.5/4) and olive-grey mudstone with light grey (on Loskop) or
olive-grey (on Spitskop) siltstones with interbedded thin (<0.5m) lenticular siltstone and finegrained sandstone bodies displaying distinctively “gullied” basal contacts and climbing ripple

Journal Pre-proof
cross-stratification indicative of rapid scour-and-fill sedimentation. The degree of mottling
varies, but notably irregularly-shaped dusky-red (5Y4/2) mottles appear within this facies.
The mottled mudstones contain claystone-lined root moulds and horizons of brownweathering calcareous nodules some of which contain fossil bone. Of possible regional
significance is a horizon of large “stellate” nodular masses that occur in the upper part of this
facies on both sections (23.5 m on Spitskop log and 14.5 m on Loskop log of fig 3,
Supplementary Fig. S3A). Each nodular mass comprises 3–5 radially-arranged fissures that

of

taper outwards from a central cavity and are filled with vertically-orientated calcareous

ro

laminae. In cliff outcrops these large (+/- 0.5 m diameter) nodules are evenly-spaced along

-p

strike approximately 10 m apart. They are interpreted to be part of a large scale polygonal

re

network of shrinkage cracks possibly related to drying of the alluvium on the ancient
floodplain as regional water tables dropped (Khadkikar et al., 1998; Smith and Botha, 2005).

lP

We begin to observe at both Spitskop and Loskop, distinctive tubular Katbergia burrow casts

na

in this facies (Supplementary Fig. S3B). These 2–3 cm diameter, straight, cylindrical burrow
casts dip at a consistent 45°, but are randomly oriented. They display a knobbly outer surface

Jo
ur

with many small ridges mostly at a low angle to the long axis of the cast, that have been
interpreted as grooves in the tunnel walls made by a scratch-digging decapod (Gastaldo and
Rolerson, 2008).

The sandstone bodies are composed of two to three vertically-stacked units structured
by horizontal lamination that grades upwards into climbing ripple cross-lamination. A few of
the elongated basal scours contain lenses of reworked mudrock pebbles and flakes, but
pedogenic glaebules are rare.
This facies marks the first appearances of patchy reddening in the mudrocks along
with vertically stacked sheet sandstones with fluted and gullied basal surfaces, and Katbergia
burrows. The onset of mudrock reddening in the upper Balfour Formation has been

Journal Pre-proof
previously recognized as a feature marking the base of the Palingkloof Member (Johnson,
1976). We also find increased maturity of the palaeo-pedogenic carbonate horizons,
xeromorphic taproot structures and changes in the taphonomic style of the tetrapod fossils in
this facies. Smith and Botha-Brink (2014) noted that the majority of the in situ tetrapod
fossils recovered from this facies comprised partial rather than complete bones with evidence
of pre-burial breakage and the preferential preservation of maxillary caniniform processes,
basioccipitals and isolated cervical vertebrae of both Moschorhinus kitchingi and L.

of

maccaigi. Although colour alone does not indicate increased aridity (Li et al., 2017), we

ro

consider the combination of the features listed above to be linked to a lowering of the

-p

watertable in the floodplains along with a change from seasonally fluctuating yet still

re

perennial flow to more ephemeral flash flood-type hydrology in the distributary channels
(Smith and Botha-Brink, 2014). This interpretation is supported by recent isotopic studies

lP

that have found climatic changes such as increased aridity in the upper Daptocephalus

na

Assemblage Zone (MacLeod et al., 2017; Rey et al., 2016, 2017).
Plant fossils were found in the uppermost Permian facies (Fig.4A–F) on both Spitskop

Jo
ur

and Loskop. Sphenophyte axes with longitudinal ribbing continuous through the nodes are
common in both facies A and B. Paracalamites stems preserve well in the fossil record and
are one of the few types of plant remains that survive palaeosol formation, probably due to
their tough, silica-imbued cell walls. Unfortunately, in the absence of attached leaves, they
provide little information, other than demonstrating the abundance of equisetalean horsetail
ferns in these latest Permian settings. Paracalamites stems are also one of the few plant body
fossils that have been found in the lowermost Katberg Formation as defined here, eg. Bethel
763 in the Free State (Gastaldo et al, 2005; see later comments in Gastaldo et al., 2017).
Glossopteris leaf impressions occur in facies B at Spitskop (Figs 4 A–D) and are
consistent with forms found at other latest Permian localities at Bethel 763 in the Free State,

Journal Pre-proof
the New and Old Wapadsberg Pass and Old Lootsberg Pass localities near Graaff Reinet in
the Eastern Cape, and Ennersdale in KwaZulu-Natal in the eastern Karoo Basin (Gastaldo,
2005; Prevec et al. 2010; Gastaldo et al., 2017; pers. obs. R. Prevec). These leaves are
typically elongate-lanceolate, strap-like and diminutive with fine-meshed, curved venation
arching at a steep angle, similar to forms assigned by other authors to Glossopteris
angustifolia Brongniart and Glossopteris linearis McCoy (e.g. Lacey et al., 1975; White,
1978).

of

The only fertile glossopterid specimens found at Spitskop, were several Lidgettonia

ro

cupules. Despite extensive bulk collecting at the Wapadsberg Pass localities (Prevec et al.,

-p

2010), the only glossopterid elements recovered were of this same leaf morphotype (referred

re

to as W1) and Lidgettonia fructifications. The association between this leaf morphotype and
fructifications of the Lidgettoniaceae has been previously documented in detail by Anderson

lP

and Anderson (1985) at numerous late Permian localities in KwaZulu-Natal, providing

na

widespread and compelling evidence for their affiliation.
The discovery of a short shoot bearing the small, narrow leaves of Glossopteris

Jo
ur

morphotype W1, is of interest as it represents the first example of this morphotype preserved
in attachment to a stem. The abscission scars on the shoot, the close, spiral arrangement of
the leaves, the long leaf bases and the presence of rhombic bud-scales at the shoot terminus
(Figs 4 C, D)., are consistent with G. linearis-bearing shoots reported by White (1978; fig. 4,
p. 479) from the Upper Permian of Australia.
Several insect wings were found in association with the plant fossils in facies B on
Spitskop, all of them grylloblattids (A. Nel, pers. comm., 2018). The best preserved of these
is illustrated in Fig. 4G, and may belong to the Liomopteridae, one of the most abundant
families in the upper Permian fossil record of KwaZulu-Natal (eg. Aristov and Mostovski,
2013).

Journal Pre-proof
On both Spitskop and Loskop, vertebrate fossils of the Daptocephalus AZ are fairly
abundant in exposures of facies B. Specimens of Lystrosaurus maccaigi and Daptocephalus
leoniceps (Fig. 5B) are relatively common, with Dinanomodon rubidgei, Dicynodontoides
recurvidens and L. curvatus less so. Vertebrate fossils are typically preserved as isolated
skulls, partially articulated cranial and postcranial remains, or isolated postcrania, with the
notable exception of two near complete theriodont skeletons lying in close proximity to one
another within massive siltstone on Spitskop. One specimen is a large (425 mm basal skull

of

length) gorgonopsian (NMQR 4000) comprising a complete skull, vertebral column (to the

ro

pelvic girdle) and partial ribs, complete right and partial left scapula, both clavicles,

-p

coracoids, metacoracoids, sternum, partial ilia and right femur all in articulation, and a

re

disarticulated humerus, ulna, radius and tibia. Approximately 15 cm away from this specimen
lay an almost complete, articulated therocephalian, Moschorhinus kitchingi (NMQR 3939),

lP

with only the left manus, right forelimb, left hind limb, right pes, tail and left side of the

na

pelvic girdle missing (Fig. 5C, D). The disarticulated postcranial bones from the
gorgonopsian are scattered on either side of the Moschorhinus skeleton (Fig. 5C, D). The

Jo
ur

disarticulated gorgonopsian bones have all been moved in the same direction (i.e. towards the
Moschorhinus skeleton), suggesting transportation by fluid flow rather than scavenger action.
No tooth punctures or grooves were found on either skeleton. Interestingly, an isolated
gorgonopsian femur was found near the base of the Moschorhinus skeleton, however the rest
of the disarticulated gorgonopsian postcrania occurred approximately 10 cm higher up but
still within the same bed, level with the top of the Moschorhinus skeleton. A comparable 3-D
association of semi-articulated skeletons of two Moschorhinus and a Lystrosaurus maccaigi
was described from the same stratigraphic level and in similar facies on Bethel 763 (Smith
and Botha-Brink, 2014: p. 109), which was interpreted as a possible carnivore-rich miring

Journal Pre-proof
scenario similar to that of the Pleistocene Rancho La Brea bonebeds in California (Spencer et
al., 2003).
A relatively large non-mammalian cynodont was also recovered from facies B. The
material consists of cranial fragments (jugal, unidentifiable fragments), a lower jaw (partial
dentary, articular), and some postcranial fragments. To date only one large non-mammalian
cynodont has been described from the uppermost Permian, namely Vetusodon elikhulu
(Abdala et al., 2019). Our specimen is more robust than Procynosuchus and may therefore

represent Vetusodon (F. Abdala, pers. comm., 2019) or a particularly robust specimen of

Cynosaurus.

4.1.3. Facies C–Dark reddish-brown mudstone and olive-grey mudstone-siltstone couplets
This easily recognisable facies (Fig. 3, Table 1, Supplementary Fig. S1, S3C–E,

lP

Supplementary Table S1) varies from just under 2 m thick on Loskop to approximately 3 m

na

thick on Spitskop, but occurs at the same position in the facies sequence in both measured
sections. The main sedimentological feature of this facies is the presence of distinctive thinly-

Jo
ur

bedded mudstone-siltstone couplets, each 1–3 cm thick, with a sharp flat basal surface and an
upward fining texture. The coarser arenaceous siltstone beds are olive-grey (5Y4/2) whereas
the mudstone laminae are dark reddish-brown (2.5YR 2.5/4). On Spitskop (Fig. 3, 19–22 m),
the couplets change colour midway through the unit from dark reddish-brown mudstone and
olive-grey siltstone to olive-grey mudstone and dark reddish-brown siltstone. Individual 2
cm-thick couplets can be traced laterally throughout the outcrop (approximately 8 m along
strike on Spitskop) with no visible desiccation cracks, pedoturbation, calcite precipitation, or
bioturbation (apart from isolated Katbergia burrows).
Fern occurrences in the late Permian fossil record are extremely rare, and have been
limited until now to fragments of Neomariopteris (Sphenopteris) lobifolia from the

Journal Pre-proof
Wuchiapingian of KwaZulu-Natal (Lacey et al., 1975; Anderson and Anderson, 1985; Prevec
et al., 2009). The few attached pinnules found in this facies at Spitskop are poorly preserved
and the manner of pinnule attachment is unclear. In the absence of sporangia, a conclusive
identification is not possible (Figs 4E, F). This is the first record of a fern from the
Palingkloof Member of South Africa.
No vertebrate fossils were found in facies C at our study site. However, fragmented
and isolated bones of the upper Permian taxa Daptocephalus leoniceps, Lystrosaurus

of

maccaigi, Dicynodontoides recurvidens and Moschorhinus kitchingi have been found in this

ro

facies at the nearby Bethel 763, approximately 34 km to the southwest (Smith and Botha-

interbedded with minor thin fine-grained sandstone sheets. The tabular sheet sands are
structured with horizontal to climbing ripple lamination and have distinctive sharp flat basal
and upper contacts, the former commonly with sand-filled desiccation polygons and the latter
preserving patches of claystone-veneered oscillation ripples (i.e., 13 m on Spitskop log of Fig
3). Horizons of rough-surfaced irregularly-shaped calcareous nodules and scattered small
spherical glaebules (possible pisoliths) with internal shrinkage cracks are ubiquitous to these
massive mudrock beds (Supplementary Fig S4A, B). The distinguishing sedimentological
features of this facies include predominance of the dark reddish-brown (2.5 YR 2.5/4),
massively bedded, silty mudstone, in contrast to the greyish-brown mudstone (2.5Y/2) of the
lower facies. Upsection, this facies gives way to numerous thin beds of predominantly olive-

Journal Pre-proof
grey siltstone, which are ultimately truncated by the erosively-based conglomeratic
sandstones of facies E of the Katberg Formation. The silt and sand-filled desiccation cracks
and the presence of silt granules in the red mudrocks are interpreted as the first indication of
aeolian dust in the depocentre. A loessic contribution to the thick massive silty-mudstone is
supported by their uniform massive texture with planar or gently undulating contacts that are
commonly veneered with claystone indicative of relatively rapid, episodic sedimentation
(Giles et al., 2013). Weakly developed pedogenesis with textural BCa horizons showing

of

claystone-lined shrink/swell planes and small spherical carbonate nodules are interpreted as

ro

immature loessic soils similar to the Triassic loessites described by Chan (1999) from the

re

Fossils within facies D at the study site include taxa typical of the Lower Triassic
Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone, namely L. murrayi (Fig. 6A), L. declivis, L. curvatus and the

lP

archosauriform Proterosuchus fergusi (Botha-Brink et al., 2014). The therocephalians

na

Olivierosuchus parringtoni and Moschorhinus kitchingi have been found at this site by
previous workers (Kitching, 1977; Botha-Brink et al., 2014), and our recent collecting has

Jo
ur

yielded articulated skeletons of Tetracynodon darti (Fig. 6B), as well as several indeterminate
baurioids. Interestingly, cynodonts such as Thrinaxodon and Galesaurus that are relatively
common in these facies on Bethel 763, have yet to be recovered from either Loskop or
Spitskop.

A biostratigraphically important discovery is the recovery of five in-situ L. maccaigi
specimens from Triassic facies D on both Loskop and Spitskop (Fig. 6C–E). Although
Lystrosaurus maccaigi has been found in Triassic strata in Antarctica (Cosgriff et al., 1982),
it was, until now, restricted to the latest Permian upper Daptocephalus AZ in the South
African Karoo Basin where it was typically found at levels no higher than the lower
Palingkloof Member (Botha and Smith, 2007; Smith and Botha-Brink, 2014; Viglietti et al.,

Journal Pre-proof
2016). Four of these new specimens were found in dark reddish-brown mudstone, at the same
level as an in situ L. murrayi specimen on Loskop, approximately 7.5 m above the top of the
mudstone/siltstone couplets of facies C (Fig. 3A, vertebrate numbers 20–23). The fifth
specimen was found approximately 9 m above the facies C mudstone/siltstone couplets on
Spitskop in an olive-grey siltstone (Fig. 3B, vertebrate number 40). The identification of
these specimens as L. maccaigi is confirmed by the presence of relatively large, upward and
forward facing orbits, prominent prefrontal and frontal bosses along the dorsal margin of the

of

orbit, frontal rugosities, a sharply angled, relatively wide snout and generally higher cranial

ro

robustness compared to other Lystrosaurus species, regardless of body size (Brink, 1951;

re

Cluver, 1971; Grine et al., 2006; Botha and Smith, 2007).

4.1.5. Facies E–Conglomeratic sandstone / olive-grey mudrock

lP

This facies (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. S1, Supplementary Table S1) is composed of

na

vertically-stacked, tabular, generally fine-medium-grained, light-grey sandstone bodies
separated by intervals of upwardly thinning beds of blocky-weathering olive-grey siltstone

Jo
ur

and rare, fissile, dark reddish-brown mudstone. The thicker (3–5 m) multistoried channel
sandstone bodies commonly display several (two to five) irregular accretion surfaces lined
with platy mudrock clasts. A distinctive feature of this facies is elongate basal scours or
gulleys eroded into the underlying mudrocks and filled with lenses of intraformational
conglomerate (Supplementary Fig. S4C, D). The conglomerates are clast-supported and
composed of mud pebbles, reworked bone fragments, irregular shaped pedogenic glaebules
and smooth surfaced spheroidal pisoliths, many with distinctive internal septarian shrinkage
cracks. Mudrock-dominated intervals comprise metre-thick beds of alternating fissile dark
reddish brown and olive-grey mudstone with rare bodies of olive-grey siltstone interbedded
with sporadic thin (0.25–0.5 m thick), light grey, fine-grained, single-storied, sheet sandstone

Journal Pre-proof
bodies, which commonly display sand-filled, downward tapering desiccation cracks at the
basal contact. On both Spitskop and Loskop the dark reddish brown mudrocks change to
predominantly olive-grey and olive colours higher up in facies D.
King (1961) and later Stavrakis (1980) first proposed that the vertically accreted
multi-storied conglomeratic sandstone bodies in the Katberg Formation represented inchannel deposits of wide, shallow, low-sinuosity rivers with a highly fluctuating discharge
regime. Hiller and Stavrakis (1984) later described the characteristics that indicated an arid

of

fluvial setting, similar to what Smith and Botha-Brink (2014) have found. The presence of

ro

numerous, spherical, pea-sized, calcareous pisoliths (or glaebules) with septarian shrinkage

-p

cracks in the clast-supported melange of red mudrock pebbles, rolled bone fragments and

re

other pedogenic calcareous nodules at Loskop and Spitskop, indicate that they too are
reworked from the alluvium into which the channel has incised. The pisoliths are similar to

lP

those described from Quaternary calcretes of western Australia (Arakel, 1982) and the Indo-

na

Gangetic alluvial plains of India (Khadkikar et al., 2000). In both instances they are formed
by the repeated alternation between saturated and dry soil-moisture conditions under a warm

Jo
ur

climate, unpredictable rainfall regime. The appearance of similar septarian glaebules in the
PTB stratigraphic record in the main Karoo Basin serves to strengthen the sedimentological
facies interpretation for warm climatic conditions with highly seasonal rainfall in this part of
western Gondwana in the earliest Triassic. Pace et al (2009) interpreted the pisolitic
conglomerates as remnants of completely degraded landscapes. Whilst undoubtedly
indicating floodplain abandonment and incision, we regard this as normal in arid zone fluvial
systems and can find no evidence to support that these conglomerates record basinwide
landscape degradation involving Milankovitch-scale time intervals.
Vertebrate fossils from facies E include taxa similar to those found in facies D, with
increased predominance of L. murrayi and L. declivis specimens. Lystrosaurus maccaigi is

Journal Pre-proof
absent. The therocephalians Tetracynodon darti and Scaloposaurus constrictus (Fig. 6F) have
also been recovered from the upper slopes of Spitskop, including articulated skeletons.

4.2. Stable isotope results
Up to 40 metres of section from facies B–D records a period of relatively low δ13Ccarbonate
(V-PDB). The lowest δ13Ccarbonate values were recovered from both carbonate nodules and
theriodont enamel in facies B, immediately below the Katbergia-bearing couplets of facies C,

of

where δ13Ccarbonate values are generally not above -10.0 ‰ (Fig. 7; Supplementary Table S3).

ro

This precipitous negative excursion immediately preceding facies C, commonly yielding

-p

values below -10.0 ‰, has been recognised elsewhere in the Bethulie (MacLeod et al., 2000),

re

Graaff Reinet (Gastaldo et al., 2014), and other study areas of the southern Karoo (Coney et
al., 2007), and from composite sections of Karoo therapsid bioapatite (Rey et al., 2016). As

lP

with the carbon isotope data obtained from the nodules, δ13Ccarbonate values from theriodont

na

teeth obtained closer to facies C were generally more negative than those collected lower in
section in the Daptocephalus AZ (Fig. 7).

Jo
ur

Compared to the δ13C data, δ18O values showed fewer obvious trends in the Permian
portion of the section. Nevertheless, values were slightly lower in the Permian samples
(average, δ18O, -19.7 ‰V-PDB) than in the Triassic samples (average, δ18O, -16.2 ‰V-PDB).
Elsewhere in the Bethulie area, primary δ18O values from carbonate nodules were also shown
to become increasingly positive higher into the Triassic Katberg Formation, indicative of
long-term Triassic climate warming (MacLeod et al., 2000, 2017). However, this portion of
the section is not complete in our study area, constraining our sample to the underlying
Balfour Formation (Palingkloof Member).

4.3. Detrital zircon results

Journal Pre-proof
206

Pb/238U age profiles of detrital zircons (Fig. 8A–C, Supplementary Fig. S1, S2

Supplementary Table S4 University of Utah, S5 Stellenbosch University) yielded from facies
B of the lower Palingkloof Member are consistent with a latest Permian major source and a
maximum depositional age near the PTB. As many as four major modes were identified using
LA-ICPMS (Fig. 8B), which included early and late Palaeozoic peaks, the largest peak
attributed to a Permian-to-earliest-Triassic source (ca. 298–249 ± 2.7 Ma, n = 38; see Fig.
8B). We regard the latter peak as the youngest 206Pb/238U ICPMS age due to minimum

of

requirements of reproducibility (Dickinson and Gehrels, 2009). Of the 15 youngest zircons

analyzed using ID-TIMS, the youngest five yielded a mean age of 251.7 ± 0.3 Ma (2σ; mean

5.1. Chronostratigraphy of the Palingkloof Member in the Xhariep District
The Permo-Triassic Beaufort Group succession contains what is arguably the best
understood terrestrial PTB sequence in the world. Biostratigraphic studies focused on the
tetrapod range zones of the Balfour and Katberg formations in the Eastern Cape and Free
State (including the well-studied Xhariep District) established a three-phased extinction, with
the main extinction pulse restricted to geologically “short lived” event beds in the Palingkloof
Member of the Balfour Formation (Smith and Botha, 2005; Ward et al., 2005; Botha and
Smith, 2006; Smith and Botha-Brink, 2014). Nevertheless, ongoing disputes over fossil taxon
ranges and the lateral relationships of their host rocks, especially of the Palingkloof Member
and Katberg Formation, have called into question the synchronicity of vertebrate extinctions

Journal Pre-proof
recorded across the Karoo, as well as their synchronicity with the global EPME (Gastaldo et
al., 2009, 2014, 2015). Based on an analysis of sedimentation rates and ID-TIMS ages
gleaned from porcellanite-derived zircons from the upper Elandsberg Member (underlying
the Palingkloof Member) at Old Lootsberg Pass, Gastaldo et al. (2015) conjectured that the
PTB may be situated higher in the Katberg Formation, and not in the Palingkloof Member
where it is currently placed (Fig. 2). This would suggest that the entire extinction event
occurred below the Permo-Triassic boundary.

of

It should be noted that the Old Lootsberg Pass site is biostratigraphically one of the

ro

most poorly constrained PTB sites, due to the paucity of vertebrate remains, and is

-p

taphonomically atypical with its relative abundance of plants (pers. obs., R. Prevec).

re

Placement of the PTB is particularly challenging on the basis of both lithofacies analysis and
vertebrate biostratigraphy. It is not immediately clear how Gastaldo et al. (2015) positioned

lP

the PTB on their lithostratigraphic log, as the reference they cited in support of this placement

na

(Smith and Botha-Brink, 2014) only considered the Lootsberg Pass, further to the south-east,
where a profusion of vertebrate fossils in addition to lithofacies analysis, facilitated confident

Jo
ur

placement of the boundary. Gastaldo et al. (2015) interpreted the stratigraphically lowermost
occurrence of an intraformational pedogenic nodular conglomerate (PNC) at the Old
Lootsberg Pass as a marker for the lower Triassic (either the upper Palingkloof or the base of
the Katberg Formation), because this facies had been described by Botha and Smith (2006)
from the upper Palingkloof at several PTB localities in the Free State. Although
intraformational PNCs are certainly a characteristic of the upper Palingkloof Member at all of
the PTB sites studied in South Africa, it has never been cited as a stand-alone indicator facies
for the lower Triassic. It seems that Gastaldo et al. (2015) used this single first occurrence of
PNC in the Old Lootsberg Pass to calibrate the entire PTB sequence at the site, extrapolating
outwards using stratigraphic data transplanted from sections measured at the Lootsberg Pass

Journal Pre-proof
to the south-east. The single piece of biostratigraphic information available to them, viz. what
they acknowledged to be a typically Permian dicynodont within the PNC itself, was used to
propose the extension of the biostratigraphic range of the Daptocephalus AZ into the upper
Palingkloof Member, instead of acknowledging the possibility that evidence of phases of
regional water table fluctuation may be found earlier in the sequence than previously
recognised.
Viglietti et al (2016, 2017, 2018a, 2018b) identified important palaeoenviromental

of

and biochronological changes indicative of the onset of the biotic crisis, already occurring

ro

below the phased extinctions of Smith and Botha-Brink (2014), and below the porcellanite of

-p

Gastaldo et al. (2015). This research supports the onset of a biotic crisis with the earlier

re

extinction phases and the EPME occurring across this stratigraphic interval, and the authors
caution against using sedimentation rates alone such as that used by Gastaldo et al. (2015) to

lP

infer chronostratigraphic boundaries (Fig. 2). This applies particularly when considering

deposition during a time of great change in tectonics, climate and sedimentological regime in

years (Shen et al., 2011, 2012, 2013; Burgess and Bowring, 2015; Baresel et al., 2017).
Previous authors have argued that simultaneous isotopic shifts manifest in δ13C and δ18O
records from Karoo pedogenic nodules and therapsid bioapatite, and that these shifts bear
important climatic and geochronologic significance (e.g., MacLeod, 2000). Taken together
with the δ13C data, corresponding long-term positive excursions in δ18O during the
subsequent Triassic (Rey et al., 2016; MacLeod et al., 2017) have been linked to a more than
4–6 °C increase in global temperatures, as inferred from studies of several peri-Tethys marine
sections (e.g., Joachimski et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2012; Schobben et al., 2014). Our high-

Journal Pre-proof
resolution geochemical evidence corroborates that the δ13C shift leading up to the PTB was
indeed rapid in the Karoo Basin, and in our sampled portion of the Bethulie part of the basin,
it showed a negative peak within the Palingkloof Member, some 10 to 20 m below the base of
the Katberg Formation.
Our research at Nooitgedacht 68 and surrounding farms has consequently produced
the first detailed vertebrate and floral collections within a terrestrial PTB sequence that are
constrained by both relative (stable isotopes) and absolute (detrital zircon geochronology)

of

dating methods. Latest Permian detrital zircons of Karoo-aged basins have been linked to

ro

Choyio volcanism in western Gondwana during this time (Sato et al., 2015; McKay et al.,

-p

2015). Notably, our age distributions from LA-ICPMS support such a source (Fig. 8B,

re

Supplementary Fig. S1), and our mean age of 251.7 ± 0.3 Ma based on ID-TIMS (Fig. 8C)
overlaps with the only previous TIMS date reported from the Palingkloof Member more than

lP

200 km south of the study area in the Eastern Cape (Coney et al., 2007). Both of these dates,

na

however, are significantly younger than beds from the stratigraphically lower Elandsberg
Member of Old Lootsberg Pass dated to 253.4 ± 0.15 Ma (Gastaldo et al., 2015). Our zircon

Jo
ur

date corroborates that the uppermost strata of the Palingkloof Member in the Bethulie area
are latest Permian but, within the margins of error of the calibration, it encompasses the
Permo-Triassic boundary. Consequently, support for the placement of the PTB much higher
in the succession within the Katberg Formation (Gastaldo et al., 2015), and much lower in the
Old Lootsberg Pass, is lacking in the Bethulie area.
Further support for the synchronicity of the marine and terrestrial extinction events is
provided by several studies from China (Chu et al., 2016, 2018, 2019) where these authors
have found mixed continental-marine taxa from the post-extinction stratigraphic interval.
These data provide biostratigraphical correlation between marine and continental PTB beds

Journal Pre-proof
and Chu et al. (2019) suggest that the assemblages may be considered as PTB transitional
beds in marine-continental siliciclastic settings.

5.2 Identifying the terrestrial EPME interval in the Karoo Basin
We use a combination of features to identify the extinction interval in the South
African Karoo Basin. The last appearance of the dicynodont therapsids Daptocephalus
leoniceps, Dicynodontoides recurvidens and Dinanomodon rubidgei represents the

of

disappearance of the uppermost Permian fauna. The first fossils of the Lystrosaurus AZ are

ro

typically found approximately 5 metres above the LAD of the Daptocephalus AZ fauna.

-p

These taxa include the archosauriform Proterosuchus fergusi and the dicynodonts

re

Lystrosaurus declivis and L. murrayi. The latter two taxa are found by an order of magnitude
in more abundance compared to any other vertebrates from the Daptocephalus and

lP

Lystrosaurus AZ, thus displaying typical features of disaster taxa in a post-extinction

na

environment. Lystrosaurus curvatus and L. maccaigi as well as the therocephalians
Promoschorhynchus platyrhinus and Moschorhinus kitchingi are found throughout this

Jo
ur

interval throughout the Karoo Basin. This faunal turnover is found in association with the
transition from Glossopteris-dominated flora to Dicroidium-dominated flora. Specimens of
Glossopteris may be found above the vertebrate extinction interval and Dicroidium below,
but it is the change from predominantly Glossopteris to predominantly Dicroidium flora that
is found at this interval. A series of very thin, alternating dark reddish-brown and olive-grey
mudstone-siltstone couplets are found in association with the faunal turnover, which
represent periodic drying and wetting of small ephemeral water bodies. The presence of these
couplets at most PTB sites in the Karoo Basin does not suggest that a single large water body
covered the Karoo region, but that numerous small ephemeral water bodies were becoming
the norm over the large, high sinuosity, permanent rivers of the upper Permian. Mudstone-

Journal Pre-proof
siltstone couplets have been found at other stratigraphic levels in the upper Palingkloof
Member, but they are not associated with the biotic extinction interval, making these
particular couplets unique. These couplets are also found in association with a negative δ13C
excursion at or just below the extinction interval. It is the combination of these features that
allows for the identification of this interval as the terrestrial expression of the EPME and
coincides with facies C. The same facies has been logged in the same sequence at all the
southern PTB sections in the Sarah Baartman (previously Graaff-Reinet and Nieu Bethesda)

of

District as well as at the northern section at Bethel 763 in the Xhariep District. Our ID-TIMS

ro

date supports this interpretation.

-p

The extinction interval represents a transition zone and thus, it is difficult to draw a

re

line within the zone. The top of the extinction interval originally coincided with the PTB and
was originally placed at the bottom of facies C when it was first described (Smith and Ward,

lP

2001), but after the recovery of Lystrosaurus maccaigi and Moschorhinus kitchingi within the

na

mudstone-siltstone couplets it and the PTB were placed at the top of this facies because these
taxa were thought to be entirely Permian. Further collecting has shown these taxa to be

Jo
ur

survivors of the EPME as specimens have also been recovered from the upper Palingkloof
Member. Given that the last Permian taxa (Daptocephalus leoniceps and Dicynodontoides
recurvidens) have been recovered from the middle of facies C we now place the PTB at the
centre from the transition from predominantly dark reddish-brown to predominantly olivegrey mudstone-siltstone couplets. Further radiometric dating may further constrain the
position of the boundary. The extinction interval is considered a transition zone and a line
was only drawn in previous work and this study to make it easier to place the fossils on the
lithostratigraphic logs.

5.3. Palaeoenvironment and palaeoecology

Journal Pre-proof
Global responses to the terrestrial EPME appear to have been varied, similar to those
found in the marine realm. For example, despite a recent literature-based study suggesting
that land plants did not experience a mass extinction because generic diversity remained
fairly constant across the PTB (Nowak et al., 2019), another recent study, using empirical
palynological and geochemical data collected from the Sydney Basin in Australia, proposed
that the floral extinction began as soon as 252.3 Ma, some 400 000 years prior to the main
marine extinction (Fielding et al., 2019). Fielding et al. (2019) also found no evidence of

of

aridification in the Sydney Basin, in contrast to what has been reported for the Karoo Basin

ro

(Smith 1995; Smith and Ward 2001; Smith and Botha 2005; Smith and Botha-Brink, 2014).

-p

Although Retallack et al. (2003) and Tabor et al. (2007) suggested increased precipitation

re

during the earliest Triassic, the conclusions in these studies have since been debated due to
the unreliability of the methods used (in the case of Retallack et al., 2003, see Tabor et al.,

lP

2018) or independent evidence for increased aridity has been found using further

na

geochemical analysis (MacLeod et al., 2017).

Li et al. (2017) collected data from Old Lootsberg Pass and argued against increased

Jo
ur

aridity as their investigation suggested that the increased reddening near the boundary (which
is caused by the high incidence of Fe3+ in an oxidizing environment indicating a dry climate
and low water table) was due to diagenesis and not related to the climate. However, colour is
only one feature that may be used as supporting evidence for the presence of aridity.
Sedimentological evidence for increased aridity in the Early Triassic at all Karoo PTB sites
studied to date includes the presence of claystone breccias, spheroidal glaebules with septaria,
sand-filled desiccation cracks, rough-surfaced ferricrete and rhizocretions. Taphonomic
evidence for aridity includes a high concentration of carcasses alongside floodplain deposits,
numerous Lystrosaurus bonebeds containing disarticulated skeletons within floodplain
depressions, mummified carcasses and vertebrate burrow casts. These features do not indicate

Journal Pre-proof
the absence of wet conditions, but that flooding events were interspersed with long periods of
extreme drought.
Fielding et al. (2019) did find increased seasonality leading to the EPME with warmer
summer temperatures in the Early Triassic similar to what has been found in South Africa
and the differences in aridity are likely due to the Sydney Basin being closer to the coast
compared to the Karoo Basin. In Australia, coal seams occur right up to the end of the
Permian, which indicates that conditions in Australia were much wetter than in the Karoo

of

basin, even before the onset of EPME-linked climate change (Michaelsen, 2002; Fielding et

ro

al, 2019). Heterogeneity of environmental conditions across the globe would have led to

-p

differing responses in both the floras and faunas from region to region.

re

Notably, we found Glossopteris impression fossils at Spitskop up to 9 m below facies
C and Gastaldo et al. (2015, 2017) even reported Glossopteris from the Early Triassic

lP

Lystrosaurus AZ, although the vertebrate used to identify the assemblage zone at the position

na

in which the Glossopteris was found is equivocal (see Viglietti et al., 2016), and their
placement of the PTB was based on different criteria to those used by previous workers. It is

extinction zone.

Jo
ur

clear, however, that Glossopteris fossils occur within the vertebrate-defined three-phased

The Glossopteris leaf morphotype tends to be smaller in size in the uppermost
Permian compared to those lower down in the Wuchiapingian (Lacey et al., 1975; Anderson
and Anderson 1985; Prevec et al., 2009, 2010). Prevec et al (2010) suggested that the
diminutive size of the W1 Glossopteris morphotype could be a phenotypic response to
potentially toxic ashfall associated with the Wapadsberg Pass deposits, or alternatively could
reflect regional variation in this group of glossopterids. It seems most likely that this was a
regional phenomenon, given the widespread occurrence of this small-leaved form that has
been found as the dominant (and in most instances the only), leaf type in the uppermost

Journal Pre-proof
Permian Palingkloof Member at multiple sites across the Karoo Basin (Gastaldo et al, 2005,
2017; Prevec et al, 2010), and as far afield as Australia (Fielding et al, 2019; their fig. 2) and
in India, where a general reduction in size of glossopterid leaves at the Permo-Triassic
transition was also observed (Saxena et al, 2018). The tendency of plants to produce small,
narrow leaves under water stress is a well-recognised phenotypic response, as is the tendency
for plant communities to exhibit a low diversity. The prevalence of the W1 morphotype
during the latest Permian of South Africa may have been the result of the general warming

of

and drying of the climate or to the intensification of seasonal extremes in the prelude to and

ro

during the EPME.

-p

The discovery of a fern impression from within the PTB transition zone at Spitskop

re

represents the first pteridophyte found in the late Permian of the southern Karoo Basin.
Additionally, the discovery of fern fragments in palaeosols is taphonomically highly unlikely.

lP

Given the very low odds of plant fossilization in these strata, it indicates that they were likely

na

abundant, at least within this localized habitat during times of water availability.
Updating the biostratigraphic ranges of the recently recovered vertebrates moves the

Jo
ur

lower limit of Smith and Botha-Brink’s (2014) Extinction Phase 2 slightly higher to 15 m
below the boundary interval (Fig. 9). Our radiometric date of 251.7 ± 0.3 Ma gives a
maximum age of 252 Ma at 6.5 m below the extinction interval, suggesting that Phase 2 may
have lasted as long as 300 000 years (similar to the onset of the floral extinction in the
Sydney Basin, Fielding et al., 2019). We accept that our new date was derived from detrital
rather than primary airfall tuff bed material and consequently has a large error margin. Until
more datable tuff horizons are recovered from the Extinction Phase 2 interval, the duration of
this phase must remain speculative. It is clear, however, that the vertebrate fossils collected
from Loskop and Spitskop are indicative of the upper Permian Daptocephalus and Triassic
Lystrosaurus AZ, and show facies associations (facies A–E) similar to those documented at

Journal Pre-proof
PTB sites in other areas of the Karoo Basin, suggesting that the facies and associated
vertebrate succession reported in previous studies (e.g. Smith and Botha-Brink, 2014) were
not isolated, local events (Fig. 10). Sites in the southern part of the Karoo Basin contain
thicker facies compared to those in the northern part of the basin (Fig. 10), but the sequence
of each facies and pattern of faunal extinctions remains similar. To account for the
heterogenous nature of Karoo Basin strata, it is important to examine as many sites
containing the extinction interval as possible. All sites studied to date have a suite of features

of

that allow us to identify the extinction zone and conclude that the transition from Permian to

ro

Triassic ecosystems at these sites was essentially contemporaneous. However, each site also

-p

has unique characteristics that makes some sites clearer than others. The site at Old Lootsberg

re

Pass, for example, is one such problematic site (based on the presence of a fault), which
makes any data from this site dubious. There are, however, several other sites that do not

lP

have this problem, where the couplets (e.g. Bethel 763, Commandodrift Dam, Nooitgedacht

na

68), vertebrate biostratigraphy (e.g. Bethel 763, Old Wapadsberg, Nooitgedacht 68),
geochemistry (e.g. Bethel 763, Carlton Heights, Nooitgedacht 68) etc. are particularly clear.

Jo
ur

We recommend utilizing all available information to define the extinction or transition zone,
and caution against basing the position of the terrestrial PTB in the Karoo Basin on
palaeomagnetic data alone (Gastaldo et al., 2015), given the abundance of dolerite dykes and
sills affecting the data.

6. Conclusions
Multiple lines of evidence, including a new radiometric date, provide a compelling
argument for the placement of the extinction interval within the Palingkloof Member of the
Balfour Formation, Beaufort Group, Karoo Supergroup. These include the recognition of a
distinctive sequence of facies from A–E that portray a consistent trend in sedimentary

Journal Pre-proof
features resulting from regional changes in climate and fluvial regimes, a strong ??13C
negative excursion within facies C, and most critically, the same patterns in faunal and floral
turnover within this interval. We suggest that facies C consistently coincides with the major
end-Permian pulse of extinctions, and together with the rich associated fossil record of the
Karoo Basin, presents the most consistent and compelling means of identifying the PermoTriassic transition in South Africa.

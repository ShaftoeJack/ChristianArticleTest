Introduction
The main Karoo Basin of South Africa contains the most
abundant, diverse, and time expansive record of terrestrial
vertebrates around the Palaeozoic-Mesozoic transition. This
10 km thick sedimentary succession accumulated in a large
intracratonic, retro-arc, foreland basin ( Johnson 1991; Catuneanu
et al. 2005) in front of the rising Cape Fold Belt portion of the
Gondwanide Mountain range that fringed the southern margin
of Gondwana. Today, rocks of the Karoo Supergroup have a
spatial distribution of some 300 000 km2 (Smith 1990), which is
more than one-half the land surface of South Africa. They were
deposited under environments ranging from glacial through
intracontinental shallow marine, ﬂuvio-lacustrine, ﬂuvial, and
aeolian providing an almost continuous 110-My record of
continental sedimentation from the Late Carboniferous (300 Ma)
to the Early Jurassic (190 Ma).
Abundant plant and animal fossils occur in most rock units
of the Karoo Supergroup, providing insights into continental
biodiversity from the Guadalupian to the Early Jurassic. This

record has been crucial to studies of the late Guadalupian,
end-Permian, and end-Triassic mass extinction events. The
temporal framework for the Karoo record comprises tetrapod
assemblage zones, representing associations of tetrapod (mostly
therapsid) genera.
Although early geologists in South Africa used reptilian
fossils to identify what would become the Beaufort Group (e.g.
Bain 1845), biozones based on an assemblage of tetrapod forms
was ﬁrst suggested by Seeley (1892). This concept was
expanded by Broom (1906a, 1906b, 1907, 1909), who proposed
a six-fold biostratigraphic zonation for the Beaufort Group based
on genera that, with slight modiﬁcation (Hotton and Kitching
1963), was accepted by most for the next sixty years (Von Huene
1925; Du Toit 1954). Subsequent collecting in the Karoo Basin
allowed for further revision of the Beaufort biostratigraphy
(Kitching 1970, 1977, Keyser and Smith 1979; Keyser 1979; SACS
1980) and included the Elliot and Clarens formations of the
upper Stormberg Group (Kitching and Raath 1984). In 1995,

INTRODUCTION TO THE TETRAPOD BIOZONATION OF THE KAROO SUPERGROUP

BSR edited a multi-authoured volume commissioned by the
South African Commission for Stratigraphy that formalised
the Beaufort Group biozones as assemblage zones deﬁned by
the co-occurrence of three or more index taxa, but for simplicity
named after only one (Rubidge 1995).
Recent research has demonstrated the importance of
Karoo fossils for global stratigraphic correlation and for the
conceptualization of basin development models (e.g., Catuneanu,
Hancox, and Rubidge 1998; Hancox 1998; Neveling 2002;
Rubidge 2005). The discovery of datable ash beds that can be
linked to biozone-deﬁning fossils has considerably enhanced
research possibilities by providing high-resolution radiometric
ages for the Permian biozones (Rubidge et al. 2013; Day et al.
2015; Gastaldo et al. 2015, 2020), and thus opening up a way
to ascertain rates of evolution in fossil tetrapod lineages
(Roopnarine et al. 2017) , as well as the timing and duration of
extinction events (e.g. Botha et al. 2020). The recent development
of a geographic information system-based database of all the
Karoo fossil tetrapods housed in South African national
collections has facilitated research on tetrapod biodiversity and
biogeographic changes during the Permian and Triassic (Nicolas
2007; Nicolas and Rubidge 2009).

This volume is an updated, reﬁned, and extended version
of Rubidge (1995), known to many as the ‘purple book’, and
incorporates ﬁndings from the vast amount of new data
collected over the past 25 years. This volume expands on its
predecessor in that it presents, for the ﬁrst time, a formal
biozonation scheme for the Stormberg Group. Thus, the
Beaufort and Stormberg groups can now be divided into nine
tetrapod assemblage zones, many of which can be constrained
by radiometric ages (Table 1). We also formalize the subdivision
of four assemblage zones into subzones, including the longestablished (and utilized) subzones of the Triassic Cynognathus
Assemblage Zone, as concurrent range zones deﬁned by the
co-occurrence of only two tetrapod index taxa. The resulting
increase in biostratigraphic resolution should facilitate more
precise correlation of these strata with equivalent sequences
elsewhere in the world, which in turn will provide more
precise temporal constraints on tetrapod evolution.
We also present an updated map showing the geographic
distribution of the assemblage zones in outcrop (Figure 1), as
well as a composite stratigraphic section showing the ranges
of all taxa mentioned in the descriptions of each assemblage
zone (Figure 2).

The biostratigraphic framework we present here is the state of
affairs as of 2020; research and ﬁeld collecting efforts in the
Karoo remain active and new data is likely to provide further
reﬁnements in the near future, particularly regarding the
Cistecephalus and Tapinocephalus assemblage zones. Some
areas remain contentious, particularly surrounding the position of
the Permian/Triassic boundary and the age of the Cynognathus
Assemblage Zone. It nevertheless represents a major step forward.
The following articles in this volume are formal descriptions
of the nine Karoo tetrapod biozones presented in ascending
chronological order. Each was written as a separate publication
by the recognised South African researchers who have done the
most recent work on the relevant biozone. The manuscripts
were subsequently reviewed independently by national and
international experts in the ﬁeld.

INTRODUCTION TO THE TETRAPOD BIOZONATION OF THE KAROO SUPERGROUP

JAMES WILLIAM KITCHING

1922 TO 2003
James Kitching was a world-renowned fossil-ﬁnder and the doyen of Karoo palaeontology. Throughout his
working career (1945 to 1990) he was employed at the Bernard Price Institute for Palaeontological Research
(now Evolutionary Studies Institute) at the University of the Witwatersrand, and has the distinction of
having been the ﬁrst member of staff hired by the institute as a fossil-ﬁnder and ending his career as the
director. This volume is a tribute to his lifelong interest in Karoo fossils, and his passion for ﬁeldwork. There
is no doubt that he laid the foundation for the latest biozonation scheme presented here, and his efforts
are gratefully acknowledged by every author.

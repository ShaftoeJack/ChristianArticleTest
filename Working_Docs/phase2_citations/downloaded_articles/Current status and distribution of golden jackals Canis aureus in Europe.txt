ABSTRACT
1. The golden jackal Canis aureus is one of the most widespread canid species with
a range covering areas of central, eastern and southern Europe, northern Africa and
parts of Asia. Distribution of the golden jackal in Europe has been dynamic, including
dramatic declines (until the 1960s), recovery (1960s and 1970s) and expansion (from
the early 1980s onwards).
2. We present up-to-date information on golden jackal status in Europe and range
expansion.
3. For data collection we reviewed the scientific literature and contacted scientists
from the relevant countries. We distinguished between vagrant animals and established populations.
4. In the last decade, there has been an increase in jackal records in areas where the
species has not been reported before. Increased presence is recorded northwards and
westwards of the distribution range of the golden jackal, specifically in Hungary,
Serbia and Slovakia. In Austria, the first case of reproduction was confirmed in 2007;
reproduction has also recently been reported in Italy.
5. Results indicate an ongoing expansion in Europe’s jackal population, with a
particular spread of the Balkan populations towards central Europe. Although there
are numerous reports of sightings, only few originate from confirmed sources and in
many areas status is unknown or vague. There is a general lack of ecological data and
almost no information on ecological consequences associated with the golden jackal
expansion.

INTRODUCTION
The golden jackal Canis aureus is one of the most widely distributed canid species
and is found in many areas of Europe, Asia and Africa (Moehlman 1983, Sillero-Zubiri
et al. 2004). Despite its widespread distribution, there is little quantitative information on jackal densities or distribution (Sillero-Zubiri et al. 2004). In Europe, jackal
populations have undergone significant populations changes in the past decades
(Kryštufek et al. 1997), including changes in distribution and abundance. However,
assessing the actual distribution of golden jackals is difficult as reports are often
anecdotal, are published in local hunting magazines and are prone to remaining
unverified by the scientific community (Kryštufek et al. 1997). In such reports, it is
also difficult to differentiate between vagrant animals and established populations
(Zachos et al. 2009).
In Europe, the golden jackal has typically been distributed in the Balkan region
(Demeter & Spassov 1993, Kryštufek et al. 1997). Here golden jackals nearly became
extinct in many areas during the 1960s due to habitat loss and persecution with
poisoned baits (Spassov 1989). Core populations were found only in some scattered
regions, for example, Strandja (Bulgaria and Turkey), the Dalmatian coast, Aegean
Macedonia and the Peloponnesus (Spassov 1993, Giannatos 2004, Spassov 2007).
Following legislative protection in 1962, the golden jackal initially re-colonized its
former territories in Bulgaria (Spassov 1989) and became established in Romania and
Serbia (Kryštufek et al. 1997). More recently, during the 1980s, individuals appeared
in Italy, Slovenia, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia (Demeter 1984, Lapini & Perco 1988,
Hoi-Leitner & Kraus 1989, Kryštufek & Tvrtkovič 1990, Lapini et al. 1993, Bauer &
Suchentrunk 1995, Hell & Rajský 2000, Heltai et al. 2000). Current changes in distribution and population sizes are presumably a result of protected status and reduced
persecution. Golden jackals are of particular interest to both conservationists (directive 92/43/EEC, Annex V, Anonymous 2007a) and game managers (as generalist
predators), and are often regarded as invasive species. The species is not yet included
in the Large Carnivore Initiative for Europe, showing a lack of attention for this
adaptive colonizer. As populations of jackals appear to be spreading in Europe, we
present a timely update on past reviews of jackal status in Europe (Demeter &
Spassov 1993, Kryštufek et al. 1997, Mitchell-Jones et al. 1999), which will be a useful
tool for both planning future conservation efforts and mitigation of human–wildlife
conflicts.
METHODS
Our area of focus spreads from the Atlantic coast of Portugal westwards to Greece
and the Bosporus and northwards along the Black Sea coastline, to the Ukraine,
Belarus and Baltic states in the east and along a north-south axis from Norway to
Spain.
An intensive literature search was performed using search engines such as Web of
Science and Google Scholar; golden jackal populations and occurrence of vagrant
animals were compiled for European countries (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. Approximate distribution of golden jackal populations in Europe. Dark shaded areas show
established populations with reproduction. White dots indicate confirmed vagrant specimens,
which represent the most north-western and north-eastern distribution areas of the golden jackal.

Where information was missing from peer reviewed literature, colleagues from
scientific departments, federal agencies and non-governmental organisations from
the relevant countries were contacted for detailed information.
We distinguished between vagrant animals (single confirmed records of jackal
presence) and established populations (defined as clusters of reproducing animals
independent of population size). For each country section we give recent information on jackal distribution in the context of the published accounts in the reviews of
the 1990s (Demeter & Spassov 1993, Kryštufek et al. 1997, Mitchell-Jones et al. 1999).
For countries where reliable current information is missing, we summarize status as
last documented in the literature.
RESULTS
European countries with golden jackal presence and recent appearance are given
in alphabetical order (see also Table 1). Results are also shown in the maps (Figs 1
and 2).
Albania
Golden jackal distribution in Albania remains cryptic. Published accounts dating back
to the 1950s and 1960s report a distribution mainly along the coastline (Atanassov
1953, Heptner & Naumov 1974, Kryštufek et al. 1997). There are no recent accounts
of jackal distribution in Albania, and the species seems to be close to extinction in
this region (Giannatos 2004).
Austria
Since the late 1980s, immigrating individuals appeared in Austria, but there was no
evidence of an established population. The first confirmed specimen in Austria was

found in 1987 in Styria (Humer 2006). During the following years (1989–98), vagrants
were sighted, shot or found dead in six of nine Austrian provinces: Carinthia, Styria,
Burgenland, Upper and Lower Austria (Hoi-Leitner & Kraus 1989, Bauer & Suchentrunk 1995, Petrakovics 1996, Spitzenberger 2002). In 2006, a questionnaire of
hunters was conducted which provided four unconfirmed records between 2004 and
2005 (Styria, Burgenland, Upper Austria), and a record of a shot specimen in 1996
(Upper Austria; Humer 2006). Furthermore, one confirmed specimen was found dead
on the freeway A2 in Upper Austria in 2006 (Franz Suchentrunk & Theodora Steineck,
pers. comm.). Plass (2007) reports three more records from 2003–05 which probably
include two of the unconfirmed specimens from the questionnaire mentioned
above, but also one shot golden jackal from the Wienerwald (Upper Austria) in
2003 (F. Spitzenberger in Plass 2007). Accordingly, a total of 17 confirmed and three
unconfirmed golden jackal records exist for Austria between 1987 and 2007. In 2007,
the first evidence of reproduction by golden jackals in Austria was reported in the
Austrian-Hungarian border area near Lake Neusiedl (Anonymous 2007b). The presence of golden jackals in this area was also confirmed via a camera trap in spring
2009. However, it is not known what happened to the offspring born in 2007, or
whether further reproduction occurred (Viktor Reinprecht, pers. comm.).
Bosnia and Herzegovina
As the country is surrounded by countries holding jackal populations, at least vagrant
animals are likely. However, we lack current information on the status of the species
in this area. The IUCN lists Bosnia and Herzegovina as an area of jackal presence
(Jhala & Moehlman 2008).
Bulgaria
The core European population of the golden jackal is in Bulgaria. High densities of
populations are situated in three main regions: (1) southeastern Bulgaria – from the
Kamchia river basin and the Gulf of Burgas to the Turkish border to the south and
from the Black Sea Coast to the Stara Zagora region to the west; (2) northeastern
Bulgaria – in the region between Dobrudja and Tutrakan and (3) the central part of
northern Bulgaria (the central region of the Bulgarian Danubian plain). There are
no records of golden jackals from the mountainous regions of south-western and
central Bulgaria, and populations are thought to be contiguous with the population
of Greek Macedonia through the corridor of the Struma valley (Spassov 2007).
Furthermore, the low and scarcely forested territories of the Eastern Rhodopes with
low winter snow cover holds jackal populations (Evgenii Raychev unpublished data,
Spassov & Markov 2004, Spassov 2007). Current populations of jackals are believed
to be stable in Bulgaria. Based on analysis of hunting data, the total population
in Bulgaria has been estimated as approximately 10000 (Spassov & Markov 2004,
Spassov 2007). The expansion of the jackal in the late 1970s and the 1980s was
related to the official protection of the species in the 1960s (Genov & Vassilev 1989),
to the further prohibition of killing by poison, and to the development of game
farming in this period, leading to increased food availability for this carnivore
species. The recent human depopulation of the Bulgarian countryside is probably
one of the main factors for the maintenance of the high density of the golden jackals
today (Spassov 1989, 2007).

European status and distribution of the golden jackal 5

Croatia
Information on current distribution is scarce. Golden jackals have been confirmed in
Dalmatia and Istria (Kryštufek et al. 1997, Krofel 2007, 2008). However, there are no
current data on density or specific distribution.
Czech Republic
The first confirmed male golden jackal was reported in 2006 (Koubek & Červenŷ
2007). The animal was found dead close to a road in southern Moravia, near the
Austrian and Slovakian border region.
Germany
Möckel (2000) reported the first evidence of golden jackals in Germany. A male
golden jackal had been confirmed in southern Brandenburg from 1996 until it was
shot in 1998. There are no further confirmed records of golden jackal.
Greece
Jackal populations declined between the early 1970s and 1980s, due to poisoning
campaigns and intensive hunting (Giannatos et al. 2005). As a result, in 2010 the
distribution of golden jackal remains discontinuous and fragmented in Greece (Giannatos 2004), and populations occur in seven split subareas located in Evros, VistonidaNestos, Serres, Halkidiki, Fokida, Peloponnesus and Samos (Giannatos 2004). Each
subarea contains one to nine jackal population clusters and each population consists
of one to 42 territories. The estimated number of golden jackals in Greece according
to survey data from 2000–01 was 1000 individuals (Giannatos et al. 2005); the highest
density was estimated to occur in Vistonida-Nestos: 30 individuals per 1000ha (Heltai
et al. 2007). Kryštufek et al. (1997) documented in their review the presence of
golden jackals on the Ionian Islands, particularly Leukas and Kephallina. However,
presence of golden jackals on the Ionian islands cannot be confirmed in 2010
(Giorgos Giannatos, pers. comm.).
Hungary
Until it became extinct in the country in the first half of the 20th century, the golden
jackal was indigenous to Hungary. Beginning in the early 1980s, immigrating individuals re-appeared in former territories, and this led to the re-establishment of a
viable population in 1991–92 (Szabó et al. 2009). Since then, golden jackals have
formed three distinct subpopulations in three counties (Bács-Kiskun, Baranya,
Somogy) in the southern region of Hungary (Heltai et al. 2000). Heltai et al. (2000,
2004) report a significant increase of killed jackals in hunting bags from 1997 (11
shot) to 2004 (95 shot). Populations have continued to increase (Szabó et al. 2009),
and the core of jackal distribution is still located in the south; dispersing individuals
are found spreading out to the west, north and east. As there are no apparent
limiting habitat factors, it is likely that this expansion will continue (Szabó et al.
2009). In the core areas, the highest density (estimated by acoustic survey) was 13.3
individuals per 1000ha (Szabó et al. 2008). In 2007, the population in Hungary was
estimated to be 1510 individuals, indicating a doubling of the population since 2004
(Tóth et al. 2009) and 16 years after the first breeding pair was observed in the
southern border of the country close to Croatia.

Italy
In Italy, the species has been present at least from 1985 (in the Pozzuolo del Friuli
area, Udine; Lapini et al. 2009). However, instead of a fragmented population, the
golden jackals occurred as vagrant individuals, presumably originating from Slovenia
and from the Istrian peninsula (Kryštufek et al. 1997). In 2010, range expansion is
detectable in the Julian Pre-Alps. A vagrant animal has been confirmed in the area
of Venice (Lapini et al. 2009). New data from 2009 confirmed the golden jackal in the
north, specifically in the Bolzano-Bozen province and South Tyrol; moreover, reproducing family groups have been reported (Lapini et al. 2009).
Republic of Macedonia
Kryštufek et al. (1997) reported that the golden jackal became extinct in Macedonia
during the first half of the 1960s. There is only one account of a vagrant animal since
that time (Kryštufek & Petkovski 1990). The location of the country next to Bulgaria,
which has an expanding golden jackal population, makes records of jackals in the
near future likely.
Moldova
In 2010, the golden jackal was not regarded as part of the Moldavian carnivore fauna
(Munteanu & Lozanu 2004). However, as the population in Romania is spreading it
can be expected that vagrant animals will appear in near future.
Montenegro
Golden jackals have been confirmed in the south, near the Albanian boarder at the
coast (Ada island, Schneider-Jacoby 2004). Sackl et al. (2006) report three jackals
killed on the main road (E-65) between the airport of Tivat and the village of Dub in
2002 and 2003.
Romania
According to Almasan (1995) and Murariu and Munteanu (2005), stable populations
of golden jackals have been found since 1984 in the area of Niculitel (southeast of
Dobrogea), as well as in the Danube Plain located in the southern part of the country.
Irregular presence was also reported for Brasov
, in the centre of the country. Further
spreading along the rivers Pruth and Siret is possible (see also Kryštufek et al. 1997).
Small groups of golden jackals roam in the Danube Delta. We estimate a total
population size of approximately 600 golden jackals all over Romania (authors,
unpublished data 2010).
Serbia
In Serbia, the north-eastern border with Bulgaria, and the Lower Srem are the main
areas of the golden jackal’s distribution. Large populations are located in the vicinity
of Negotin and Bela Palanka in the northeast of the country. Since 2000, 500
specimens were shot in the vicinity of Negotin alone. From this area, jackals have
spread into the Velika Morava river valley. The second population in Lower Srem has
expanded along the banks of river Sava to the slopes of Fruška Gora (Milenkovic &
Paunovic 2003). Recent findings indicate that both jackal populations are genetically
very similar and suggest strong founder effects (Zachos et al. 2009).
Slovakia
Four jackals were shot between 1989 and 2001, near Cierna, near Tisou and Lucenec,
not far from the Hungarian border. In 2008, there were unconfirmed sightings from

European status and distribution of the golden jackal 7

Banska Bystrica. If these can be confirmed, they are the first jackal records from
central Slovakia (Robin Rigg, pers. comm.).
Slovenia
In 2005, a female jackal was shot in Northern Slovenia, in the Upper Savinja Valley
(Krofel & Potočnik 2008). Jackals had been reported since 1952 (Brelih 1955) and
some were observed or shot since then, mostly on the border with Croatia (Krofel
2008).
Turkey (European part)
Golden jackals are present along the coasts of the Black Sea and Aegean Sea, but not
in the central steppe plateau (Kryštufek et al. 1997).
Ukraine
There have been reports of golden jackals in southern Ukraine (Rozhenko & Volokh
2000). In 2010, approximately 70 jackals roamed in the Odessa region (Alina Mishta,
pers. comm.). Recent accounts suggest that jackals occur up to the reserve
Biletskivsky Plavni (Poltava region, Ruzhilenko 2008).
DISCUSSION
Our review shows that expansion of golden jackals in eastern and central Europe is
ongoing. Recent confirmation of vagrant animals indicates expansion from the
Balkan population northwards and westwards. The expanding populations in Bulgaria, Serbia and Hungary suggest a further spreading towards central Europe.
Confirmed specimens from adjacent countries in the north of the Balkan population
confirm this trend. It is possible that animals form Istria are also spreading northwards, as golden jackals have appeared in Italy and Slovenia and have formed
reproducing family groups (Lapini et al. 2009). Recent findings show that a vagrant
animal from Austria was genetically indistinguishable from Serbian jackals (Zachos
et al. 2009). This example shows that genetic comparison of vagrant animals with
animals from established populations can help to identify routes of expansion.
However, such comparison has, unfortunately, not been done so far, and in many
cases routes of expansion of golden jackals in Europe are not clear. We therefore
suggest that populations of golden jackals should be monitored genetically, in order
to identify source populations (Veit et al. 2005) and routes of expansion (Manel et al.
2003).
Abundance of jackals in southern Europe is not clear for many areas. The golden
jackal population in Greece is relatively well documented. Threats are mainly linked
to fragmentation of habitats and persecution (Giannatos 2004), and management
measures are needed to secure the long-term survival of jackals in Greece (see
Giannatos 2004). Outside Greece, golden jackal abundance in the Adriatic region
remains largely unclear. There is a general lack of current information on density and
population trends, especially for Bosnia and Macedonia.
It is likely that climatic changes due to global warming will reduce barriers to the
dispersal of jackals, such as long winters with severe snow cover (Giannatos 2004).
Migration along water bodies (Szabó et al. 2006) allows long-distance spreading
(Demeter & Spassov 1993), and the absence of the natural predator of golden jackals,
the wolf Canis lupus, is likely to influence expansion positively (Kryštufek & Tvrtkovič
1990, Giannatos 2004).

Recent developments in golden jackal distribution show that this species finds
favourable habitat in eastern and central Europe. It is therefore likely that the
golden jackal will return to areas where it formerly became extinct. The golden
jackal has great colonising potential, and it is foreseeable that it will continue to
spread in Europe; it may even appear in regions where it has not been native before.
It is of concern, that background data remain poor. With the exception of Greece,
golden jackal distribution in south-eastern Europe is unclear. This lack of knowledge
makes it hard to assess population dynamics and future range development, particularly as golden jackal populations in southeastern Europe are supposed to be a
source for populations in central Europe.
Surprisingly, despite its success and spread during the last years, the golden jackal
has not been of great interest for carnivore researchers or for non-governmental
organisations in central Europe. Hence, our ecological background knowledge
remains restricted (Giannatos 2004). There is a need to investigate the development
of golden jackal distribution, as it provides a unique opportunity to observe the
reaction of communities to a novel generalist predator under the influence of
different types of habitat. The golden jackal occurs in a wide range of different
habitats covering a variety of ecosystems (Mitchell-Jones et al. 1999). We have
recently started to discover details of jackal ecology in Europe (e.g. Lanszki & Heltai
2002), and it is important to establish basic background data on behavioural and
ecological plasticity displayed in newly colonized habitats. With our current knowledge, identifying and applying suitable conservation and management actions is
hardly possible. We therefore strongly suggest that monitoring and research activity
should be intensified for this species, and that results should be published in peerreviewed journals.

Abstract Dicynodont fossils were first collected in the
Luangwa Basin, Zambia, in the 1920s, but limited detailed
study and taxonomic uncertainty have obscured their
biostratigraphic utility and their implications for topics
such as dicynodont biogeography and the effects of the endPermian extinction. Here we present a comprehensive
taxonomic revision of the dicynodonts of the Luangwa
Basin, taking into account specimens in all major museum
collections and new material collected by our team in 2009.
We recognize 14 dicynodont species from the Upper
Permian Upper Madumabisa Mudstone: Pristerodon mackayi, Endothiodon sp., Diictodon feliceps, Compsodon
helmoedi, Emydops sp., Dicynodontoides cf. D. nowacki,
a new tusked cistecephalid, cf. Katumbia parringtoni,

Kitchinganomodon crassus, Oudenodon bainii, Odontocyclops whaitsi, Dicynodon huenei, Syops vanhoepeni, and a
new lystrosaurid. Previous reports of Lystrosaurus in the
basin appear to be in error. In addition, we found no
significant partitioning of dicynodont taxa in the northern
and southern parts of the basin, despite substantial differences in preservation, indicating the presence of a single
faunal assemblage in the Upper Permian. The Madumabisa
dicynodont assemblage is best correlated with the Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone of South Africa. The shared
presence of Dicynodon huenei and possibly Katumbia in the
Luangwa Basin and the Ruhuhu Basin of Tanzania suggests
that the Tanzanian Usili Formation also can be correlated
with the Cistecephalus zone. Interestingly, the Madumabisa
assemblage from Zambia is more similar to the coeval
assemblage from South Africa, despite its closer geographic
proximity to Tanzania. The Karoo and Ruhuhu basins also
include more endemic species in the Permian than the
Luangwa Basin. The Middle Triassic Ntawere Formation
preserves four dicynodont species (Kannemeyeria lophorhinus, ‘‘Kannemeyeria’’ latirostris, Zambiasaurus submersus, Sangusaurus edentatus), which occur at two
stratigraphic levels. The lower Ntawere assemblage resembles that of the Omingonde Formation of Namibia in the
presence of Kannemeyeria lophorhinus and potentially
Dolichuranus (if ‘‘K.’’ latirostris represents this taxon).
The upper Ntawere assemblage shares the genus Sangusaurus with that of the Manda beds of Tanzania and
includes the endemic Zambiasaurus. Comparisons of these
assemblages to the Omingonde and Manda suggest that both
are best correlated with the Cynognathus C subzone. When
combined with data on other tetrapod taxa, our revised
dicynodont assemblages contribute to an emerging picture
of broad faunal similarity in southern and eastern Africa
during the Late Permian, and increasing differentiation
between the South African and other Karoo basins following the end-Permian extinction.

Introduction
Dicynodonts number among the most successful Permian
and Triassic nonmammalian synapsids in terms of their
species richness, abundance, and stratigraphic distribution.
The clade was also cosmopolitan, with dicynodont fossils
having been discovered on every continent (King 1992;
Rubidge 2005; Fröbisch 2009). However, the detail with
which the dicynodont faunas from particular areas are
known varies greatly depending on factors such as available
outcrop area and the cumulative collecting effort expended
by paleontologists. Thus, the Karoo Basin of South Africa,
which has extensive fossiliferous exposures and a history of
continuous paleontological research spanning over
150 years, has produced more than 15,000 cataloged
dicynodont specimens (Nicolas and Rubidge 2009, 2010),
making it by far the best window into the evolutionary
history of the clade. However, even other well-studied
areas, such as the fore-Ural region of Russia, have produced
far fewer specimens (e.g., Ivakhnenko et al. 1997), and
some geographically significant dicynodont records consist
of very small samples (e.g., 10 specimens from Scotland:
Cruickshank et al. 2005; five published specimens from
Laos, one of which is lost: Battail 2009a, b; Steyer 2009).
This unevenness in sampling obscures biogeographic and
biostratigraphic patterns, and it makes it difficult to determine whether apparent absences of particular dicynodont
taxa in a given area are real or artifactual. An extreme
example can be found in the geographic distribution of
Diictodon feliceps, which is known from South Africa,
Zambia, and China, but not fossiliferous basins in between
(Angielczyk and Sullivan 2008). Obviously there was a
route that D. feliceps used to disperse between these widely
separated areas, but was that route outside of areas where
Permian tetrapod fossils were preserved, or would more
intensive collecting in intermediate areas reveal novel
geographic occurrences?
A related issue is the complex taxonomic history of
dicynodonts. Over the course of the past four decades, much
of dicynodont taxonomy, particularly for Permian taxa, has
been extensively revised (e.g., Cox 1964; Keyser 1973a, b,
1975, 1993; Tollman et al. 1980; Cluver and Hotton 1981;
King 1988; King and Rubidge 1993; Sullivan and Reisz
2005; Grine et al. 2006; Botha and Angielczyk 2007;
Fröbisch and Reisz 2008; Angielczyk et al. 2009;
Kammerer et al. 2011), greatly improving our knowledge of
the clade’s diversity. However, because the majority of

named dicynodont species are based on material from the
Karoo Basin, most revisions have focused on South African
taxa. Even when non-South African taxa have been included, it is often difficult to trace a particular valid name or
synonym through the literature. If a particular name or
reported occurrence has not been dealt with explicitly in a
revision, it can be a daunting task to attempt to identify a
specimen short of personally examining it. Many of the
original reports of material from outside of South Africa
consist of very brief descriptions of fragmentary specimens
accompanied by figures that are little more than sketches
(e.g., Haughton 1926, 1932; Boonstra 1938). The dicynodont faunas of the Luangwa Basin of Zambia exemplify
many of these issues.
The first tetrapod fossils discovered in the Luangwa
Basin were two fragmentary pieces of dicynodont postcrania (SAM-PK-7424, SAM-PK-7425) collected in 1925 by
G. Prentice (Dixey 1937). The geologist F. Dixey made the
first significant collections of fossils, mostly from the
northern part of the basin, in 1928 and 1935 (Dixey 1937;
Boonstra 1938) (Fig. 7.1a). Additional collecting in the
northern part of the basin was carried out in 1960 and 1961
by the Geological Survey of Northern Rhodesia and the
Bernard Price Institute for Palaeontological Research (Brink
1963; Drysdall and Kitching 1963; Kitching 1963), and by
the British Museum (Natural History)—University of
London Joint Palaeontological Expedition in 1963 (Attridge
et al. 1964). A decade later, in 1972, members of the
Geological Survey of Northern Rhodesia discovered additional localities in the central Luangwa Basin. As a direct
result, fossil collections were made in 1974 in collaboration
with the Oxford University Museum of Natural History
(Kerr 1974; Kemp 1975). A short subsequent reconnaissance to the same area was made in 2000 by T. S. Kemp
(Oxford University Museum of Natural History),
J. G. Theime (former director of the Geological Survey of
Zambia), and associates (T. S. Kemp, personal communication, 2009). Most recently, our team spent three weeks in
July, 2009 working in both the northern and central parts of
the basin.
To date, collecting efforts have resulted in several hundred specimens that are distributed among the Iziko: South
African Museum (Prentice’s and Dixey’s collections), the
Bernard Price Institute for Palaeontological Research
(specimens from the 1960 and 1961 expeditions), The
Livingstone Museum (a small number of specimens from
the 1963 expedition), and The Natural History Museum
(most specimens from the 1963 expedition); material from
the 1974 expedition is currently housed at Oxford University but it and specimens from the 2009 expedition will be
returned to the National Heritage Conservation Commission
of Zambia. Much of this material is all but unstudied, and
only a handful of papers focusing on dicynodonts from the

Luangwa Basin have been published (Boonstra 1938; Cox
1969; Crozier 1970; Keyser 1979; Keyser and Cruickshank
1979; King 1981; Gale 1988; King and Jenkins 1997;
Angielczyk 2002), although some described particular
specimens in great detail. Of the material that has been
published, a considerable proportion has been included in
taxonomic revisions, and in some cases multiple revisions
(Keyser 1973c, 1975; Keyser and Cruickshank 1979;
Angielczyk 2002; Renaut et al. 2003; Botha and Angielczyk
2007; Kammerer et al. 2011). There is also an unpublished
report of at least one additional new taxon that has never
been formally described (Freeman 1993). These facts make
it difficult to compile accurate faunal lists for the Luangwa
Basin, but such data are necessary if broader studies of
dicynodont biogeography and biostratigraphy, and the endPermian mass extinction, are to produce meaningful results.
Here we review the Permian and Triassic dicynodont
faunas of the Luangwa Basin, based on our personal
observations of most of the Zambian dicynodont specimens

in museum collections and supplemented with observations
of dicynodont fossils in the field. Although the review uses
up-to-date dicynodont taxonomy, we provide links between
modern and older names, and provide justifications for our
identifications and images of voucher specimens for each
taxon. Finally, we discuss the biogeographic and biostratigraphic implications of the revised faunal lists.

Geological Context
Stratigraphy and Sedimentology
The Karoo basins of south-central Africa formed during the
assembly and breakup of Pangaea under two distinct tectonic regimes sourced from the southern and northern
margins of Gondwana. The southern tectonic regime, generated by subduction and orogenesis along the Panthalassan
(paleo-Pacific) margin of Gondwana resulted in the formation of the Gondwanide mountain belt with a series of
retroarc foreland basins. Subsidence and sedimentation in
these basins was primarily controlled by flexural and
dynamic loading of the crust (Catuneanu et al. 2005). The
main Karoo Basin in South Africa is the best exposed of
these foreland basins and contains the litho- and biostratigrapic reference sections for the Upper Carboniferous–
Middle Jurassic Karoo Supergroup.
North of the main Karoo Basin, tectonic regimes were
dominated by extensional or transtensional stresses that
propagated southwards into the supercontinent from the
Tethyan margin of Gondwana. The sedimentary fills of
these rift basins show a pronounced similarity due to their
similar structural history; the older Karoo deposits were laid
down and preserved within the oldest graben structures,
most of which occupy the deepest parts of the basins today.
As the rifts expanded, younger sedimentary sequences
progressively overstepped onto domino-style tilted horsts
and younger grabens. Thus, almost continuous sedimentation took place within the deep parts of the rifts whereas the
successions on the rift shoulders were interrupted by hiatuses and erosion, evidenced by unconformities and reduced
sections (Tankard et al. 2009).
Climatic fluctuations also left a mark on the stratigraphic
record, providing a common trend that can be identified in
the sedimentary fill of most of the Karoo-aged basins
formed under different tectonic regimes. The climate
changed from cold to humid temperate and semi-arid during
the Late Carboniferous–earliest Permian interval, to warmer
and eventually hot with fluctuating precipitation from the
Early Triassic through to Early Jurassic (Smith et al. 1993).
In Zambia, Karoo-aged sequences occur in the Luangwa,
Luano and Zambezi rift basins. To date, tetrapod fossils

K. D. Angielczyk et al.

have been collected in large numbers only from the
Luangwa Basin (Fig. 7.1a), although there is a report of
fragmentary dinocephalian material from the Zambezi
Basin (Gair 1959). The Luangwa Basin itself comprises two
non-overlapping opposing half-graben separated by a
transfer zone or accommodation zone that forms a structural
high (Banks et al. 1995). The sub-basins are structurally and
depositionally similar, and preserve essentially the same
stratigraphic sequence (Fig. 7.1b). Tetrapod fossils occur in
the Upper Permian Madumabisa Mudstone Formation and
the Middle Triassic Ntawere Formation in the Luangwa
Basin. Numerous Permian and Triassic fossils have been
collected in the northern sub-basin, but nearly all of the
material from the transfer zone is of Permian age. The
specimen of Luangwa drysdalli described by Kemp (1980a;
also see Kerr 1974; Kemp 1975) is the only Triassic tetrapod collected in the transfer zone to date. The vertebrate
paleontology of the southern sub-basin remains almost
entirely unexplored.
The Madumabisa Mudstone sediments accumulated on
the floor of a wide flat-bottomed rift valley with a gentle
regional slope towards the south-southwest. The sequence is
interpreted as having initially been an alluvial plain dominated by low sinuosity river channels (Lower Member of
Drysdall and Kitching 1963). As the graben widened and
the rates of sedimentation increased, the rivers became
progressively higher in sinuosity with more and more ponds
and lakes until eventually the valley floor became predominantly sub-aqueous as evidenced by the extensive,
thick beds of massive grey and green mudstones in the
Upper Member of the Madumabisa Mudstone Formation
(Yemane and Kelts 1990; Banks et al. 1995). Most of the
Late Permian vertebrate fossils are found in greenish grey
and pale brown massive siltstone beds, associated with and
often partly enclosed within smooth surfaced calcareous
nodules. The fossil rich beds are interpreted as having
accumulated by episodic, possibly catastrophic, flooding of
a vegetated floodplain.
The contact with the overlying pebbly sandstone of the
Escarpment Grit Formation is regarded as erosional
throughout the Luangwa Basin. However, the same contact
in the nearby Zambezi basin is an abrupt change of depositional style, disconformable rather than unconformable
(Bond 1967). In the main Karoo Basin, time-equivalent
strata show a transition through the argillaceous Palingkloof
member of the Balfour Formation into the arenaceous
Katberg Formation, with no disconformity, and vertebrate
fossils that record the End-Permian mass extinction event
(Smith 1995). The synchroneity of this relatively rapid
switch from cool-wet lacustrine to warm-dry fluvial depositional environments across all the Karoo basins in southern Gondwana has been attributed to CO2 degassing from
basaltic floods in northern Pangaea causing rapid global

7

Zambian Dicynodont Faunas

warming, a shift in precipitation belts, and aridification of
inland regions (Ward et al. 2005).
In the Luangwa sequence the Lower Triassic Escarpment
Grit grades upwards into semi-arid fluvio-lacustrine redbed
strata of the Middle Triassic Ntawere Formation, where the
mudrocks are predominantly dark reddish brown with
horizons of calcareous rhizocretions and nodules. Trough
cross bedded coarse-grained gritstones with intraformational conglomerates interbedded with structureless lightred siltstone beds are interpreted as ephemeral stream
channel fills incised into wind deposited loess. Stromatolitic
limestone drapes over lenses of reworked brecciated mudstone with bone clasts are part of the playa lake shoreline
facies in which many of the vertebrate fossils are found.

Vertebrate Taphonomy
The preservation style of dicynodonts in the fossil rich
localities within the Upper Madumabisa Mudstone is most
commonly isolated skulls, mostly without articulated lower
jaws, and isolated limb and girdle elements, although a few
complete articulated skeletons (some curled- up) and semiassociated skeletons also can be found. Most of the fully
articulated specimens are of Diictodon and Pristerodon and
most of the disarticulated, semi-associated skeletons are of
the medium and large dicynodonts Oudenodon and
Odontocyclops. The close association of the articulated
skeletons with mictitic nodules suggests these bones were
buried while skin and connective tissue were still present.
The organic matter subsequently decomposed to release
hydrogen sulphide into the surrounding silt, creating
reduction halos that later induced calcium carbonate to
precipitate from the groundwater. Preservation of specimens in hematite-rich nodules is more common in the
northern sub-basin than in the transfer zone, although a thin
hematite rind sometimes is present on the bone surface of
specimens from the latter area.
The dicynodonts of the Ntawere Formation have a similar taphonomic range to those of the Upper Madumabisa
Formation, but with far fewer complete articulated specimens and none found in curled-up pose. This may be due to
the disappearance of small-bodied dicynodonts such as
Diictodon, Pristerodon, and Emydops, which may have
inhabited underground burrows (Smith 1987). The larger
kannemeyeriiforms are commonly found as patches of
scattered (i.e., disarticulated but still associated) postcrania
within an area of three to five square meters, suggesting that
scavenging was more prevalent in the mid-Triassic. This
interpretation is reinforced by the occurrence of bone
bearing coprolites in and around the bone scatters (this
study and Drysdall and Kitching 1963).

Note on Treatment of Fossil Localities
The various individuals and groups who collected fossils in
the Luangwa Basin used different systems for identifying
localities. We use three sets of locality numbers in the
Systematic Paleontology section. For specimens collected
in the northern part of the basin by Dixey and the 1960,
1961, and 1963 expeditions, we use the Drysdall and
Kitching (1963; also see Kitching 1963) locality numbering
system, which incorporates and standardizes all localities up
to that time. For specimens collected by the 1974 expedition, we use the numbering system of Kerr (1974), which
was used in most of the papers describing material from this
collection (Kemp 1979, 1980b; Davies 1981; King 1981)
and can be directly related to information provided in other
publications that do not refer to localities by number (Kemp
1975; King and Jenkins 1997). Finally, we use our locality
numbers for specimens collected during the 2009 expedition (i.e., NHCC specimens with locality numbers starting
with ‘‘L’’). Detailed locality information is available to
qualified researchers from the respective museums or from
KDA in the case of specimens collected by our team.

Permian Dicynodont Fauna
We use the higher-level taxonomy of Kammerer and
Angielczyk (2009) for Permian dicynodonts, with minor
changes reflecting the results of Kammerer et al. (2011).
Our taxonomic results for Permian dicynodonts are summarized in Table 7.1.

all very fragmentary, and appear to represent parts of the
palate and/or jaws. The most diagnostic features of these
fragments are their relatively large sizes and the presence of
long, medially-placed tooth rows, both of which give them a
close resemblance to Endothiodon specimens from areas
such as South Africa and Mozambique (Fig. 7.2a–d). For
example, comparison to more complete specimens suggests
that NHCC LB12 was part of a skull with a basal length of
approximately 380 mm and NHCC LB11 originated in a
mandible with a length of approximately 300 mm, values
that are comparable to large Endothiodon specimens such as
AMNH 5565 (basal length of skull 430 mm; length of jaw
ramus 400 mm) or BP/1/1659 (basal length of skull
345 mm). However, the specimens are too fragmentary to
allow a species-level identification.
Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: Fröbisch
(2009) stated that Drysdall and Kitching (1963) and
Kitching (1963) recorded Endothiodon uniseries from the
Luangwa Basin. However, we can find no mention of that
species in those publications. Cox (1964) reported a specimen of E. uniseries collected by John Attridge from the
‘‘Madumabisa shales,’’ but of Zimbabwe, not Zambia.
Previous Reports: Kitching (1963) and Drysdall and
Kitching (1963) reported collecting two fragmentary specimens of Endothiodon at their Locality 3, which they
included in their lower fossiliferous horizon. We relocated
one of those specimens (BP/1/3574) and confirm its identification. Anderson and Cruickshank (1978), King (1988,
1992), Rubidge (2005), and Fröbisch (2009) all included

Endothiodon in the faunal lists they compiled. Cooper
(1982) and Angielczyk (2002) both mentioned Endothiodon
in their discussion of the biostratigraphic correlation of the
Madumabisa Mudstone.

specimens (e.g., BP/1/3410; Fig. 7.2e, f), show numerous
characters diagnostic of Pristerodon, including a broad
temporal region in which the parietals are exposed between
the postorbitals, leaf-shaped palatine pads, and the presence
of maxillary ‘‘postcanine’’ teeth arranged in a row that is
oblique to the sagittal plane of the skull. Identifications for
more fragmentary and/or unprepared specimens are based
on a combination of size and the presence of one or more

7

diagnostic characters. For example, the material from
locality L52 (NHCC LB9 and NHCC LB10) consists of the
remains of at least three individuals, and diagnostic material
includes a palate with an exposed tusk and an oblique row
of ‘‘postcanine’’ teeth, and two toothed dentaries, one of
which also possesses the remains of a relatively large,
rounded lateral dentary shelf.
Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: Parringtoniella (Drysdall and Kitching 1963; King 1988, 1992).
Keyser (1993) and King and Rubidge (1993) discussed the
synonymy of Pristerodon and Parringtoniella. Boonstra
(1938) referred one specimen (SAM-PK-K7933) to Emydops or Emydopsis. Although the former taxon is valid, and
the latter appears to be a junior synonym of it (King 1988),
SAM-PK-K7933 most plausibly represents a poorly preserved specimen of Pristerodon.
Previous Reports: If our identification of SAM-PKK7933 is correct, then Boonstra’s (1938) report of this
specimen is the first time a Zambian specimen of Pristerodon was mentioned in the literature, although it was not
identified as such at the time. Drysdall and Kitching (1963)
noted the occurrence of ‘‘Parringtoniella’’ at their Locality
3, but it is unclear whether they collected any of these
specimens because all of the Pristerodon material we
identified at the BP originated at their Locality 4. Anderson
and Cruickshank (1978), Rubidge (2005), and Fröbisch
(2009) all included Pristerodon in their compilations. King
(1988) included ‘‘Parringtoniella’’ in the faunal list for
Zambia, but later King (1992) suggested that this most
likely was a synonym of Pristerodon.

Identifying Characteristics: Sullivan and Reisz (2005)
and Angielczyk and Sullivan (2008) recently discussed
diagnostic characters and ranges of discrete and morphometric variability for Diictodon feliceps. The specimens we
refer to D. feliceps all are relatively small with square-cut
caniniform processes set off from the palatal rim by a notch
(Fig. 7.2i, j). In the specimens where the intertemporal
region is preserved and exposed, it is relatively narrow and
the postorbitals extensively overlap the parietals. A

99

mandible from locality L38, NHCC LB6 (Fig. 7.2h), lacks
postcanine teeth, has a dentary table that grades into a short
broad posterior dentary sulcus (see Angielczyk and Rubidge
2013 for information on the interpretation of the homologies of these characters), and the remains of a tall, convex
cutting blade on the medial side of the dorsal surface of the
dentary. The shape of the well-preserved deltopectoral crest
of NHCC LB7 (Fig. 7.2k) closely resembles those of South
African D. feliceps specimens, and other humeral fragments
from locality L38 (e.g. NHCC LB27; Fig. 7.2l) also show
the presence of an ectepicondylar foramen.
Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: Dicynodon
grimbeeki, Dicynodon sollasi, Dicynodon clarencei (Drysdall and Kitching 1963; Gale 1989). See King (1993) and
Sullivan and Reisz (2005) for discussion of the synonymies
of the first two species with D. feliceps. Dicynodon clarencei was recognized as a synonym of Dicynodontoides
recurvidens by Angielczyk et al. (2009).
Previous Reports: Based on the species identifications
given in their subsequent publications, at least some of the
specimens identified as Dicynodon by Drysdall and
Kitching (1962) likely represent Diictodon. Drysdall and
Kitching (1962, 1963) reported specimens in what they
considered the lower (Locality 3) and upper (Locality 4)
fossiliferous beds of the Madumabisa Mudstone. However,
they did not state whether these occurrences were based on
collected specimens or field reports, making confirmation of
the identifications difficult. Gale (1988) referred an assemblage of juvenile dicynodont specimens from Zambia to
Diictodon, and King (1993) followed this identification in
her discussion of Diictodon taxonomy. However, this
identification is questionable because their sizes are larger
than would be expected for Diictodon given their presumed
early ontogenetic stage, and they lack the distinctive notched caniniform process that is typical of Diictodon. Gale
(1989) referred the same specimens to Dicynodon clarencei
(a synonym of Dicynodontoides recurvidens; see
Angielczyk et al. 2009), but they also lack diagnostic
characters for that species. Anderson and Cruickshank
(1978), King (1988, 1992), King and Jenkins (1997),
Rubidge (2005), and Fröbisch (2009) included Diictodon in
the faunal lists they compiled for Zambia. Angielczyk and
Sullivan (2008) figured a largely unprepared but diagnostic
Zambian Diictodon specimen (BP/1/3598).

Identifying Characteristics: Compsodon helmoedi was
described by van Hoepen (1934) based on a small skull
(basal length approximately 100 mm) collected in the Karoo Basin of South Africa. Toerien (1954) provided additional information on the holotype and suggested that C.
helmoedi may be related to Emydops, but Cluver and King
(1983) and King (1988) treated it as a valid species of
uncertain affinities. Brink and Keyser (1983) considered C.
helmoedi to be a synonym of Tropidostoma microtrema, but
did not provide justification for this synonymy.
The holotype of C. helmoedi (NMQR 1460) (Fig. 7.3a,
d, g) is a small, laterally compressed skull with tusks and
‘‘postcanine’’ teeth, relatively large but smooth palatine
pads that are pierced by a palatine foramen, and long,
straight anterior pterygoid rami that bear prominent, triangular ventral keels. Van Hoepen (1934) stated that a fragment of tooth associated with the specimen was serrated,
and speculated that C. helmoedi may have had serrated
tusks. However, this would be unprecedented among dicynodonts, particularly because serrations are structures
associated with enamel whereas dicynodont tusks are
composed only of dentine (Camp and Welles 1956; Poole
1956), and the portions of the tusks preserved in situ in
NMQR 1460 show no evidence of serrations. The ‘‘postcanine’’ preserved on the left side of the specimen also
shows no sign of serrations. An embayment of the palatal
rim is present anterior to the caniniform process, and a
postcaniniform keel is present. Anterior palatal ridges are
absent, but a posterior median ridge is present that is
flanked laterally by longitudinal depressions (although the
depressions are poorly preserved due to lateral compression). A nasal boss with a continuous posterior border is
present on the snout, and the lateral surface of the maxilla
bears a distinctive, pocket-like depression posterior to the
external naris between the anterior orbital margin and the
caniniform process. On the skull roof, the midfrontal suture
is slightly raised, and the edges of the orbit are slightly
raised above the surface of the frontals. Posterior to the
orbital rim, the postfrontals and postorbitals are raised
above the posterior portion of the frontals and the preparietals, giving the skull roof in this area a slightly depressed

appearance. The preparietal itself is elongate, and roughly
triangular in shape, with its apex reaching the parietal
foramen. The edges of the preparietal are slightly raised,
forming weak ridges that extend to the parietal foramen,
which itself is surrounded by a slightly raised lip. The
parietals are exposed between the postorbitals on the skull
roof, although this exposure appears to be narrower than is
the case in Emydops or Pristerodon. Based on this combination of character states, including the distinctive depression on the lateral surface of the premaxilla and the raised
postfrontals and postorbitals, we consider C. helmoedi a
valid taxon that is likely part of Emydopoidea. A full
redescription and investigation of its phylogenetic relationships will be the subject of a subsequent publication.
NHCC LB13 (Fig. 7.3b, e, h) and NHCC LB14
(Fig. 7.3c, f, i) bear a striking resemblance to the type of
C. helmoedi. NHCC LB13 is almost exactly the same size
as NMQR 1460 (basal length approximately 103 mm) and
is tusked. ‘‘Postcanines’’ are not preserved, but two empty
alveoli are present posterior to the tusk on each side of the
skull. Median anterior ridges are absent on the secondary
palate, although lateral ridges similar to those found in
Diictodon or Emydops are present. A posterior median ridge
is also present, and is flanked by rounded grooves. Interestingly, the anterior portion of the median ridge forms a
flattened, Y-shaped expanded area that is reminiscent of that
seen in Eosimops newtoni (Angielczyk and Rubidge 2013).
An embayment on the palatal rim anterior to the caniniform
process is present, as is a postcaniniform keel. The palatine
pads are relatively large, smooth, and pierced by a palatal
foramen, and the left anterior pterygoid ramus preserves a
ventral keel nearly identical to that of NMQR 1460 (the
right side is damaged). The snout of NHCC LB13 is damaged, but the remains of a median nasal boss appear to be
present, and a pocket-like depression is present on the lateral surface of the maxilla. The midfrontal suture is slightly
raised, as are the orbital margins, and the postorbitals and
postfrontals are raised above the level of the posterior
portion of the frontals and the preparietal. The preparietal is
of similar shape as that of NMQR 1460, and its edges form
distinct ridges that extend to the parietal foramen. The

Scale bar is 20 mm

parietal foramen is surrounded by a slightly raised lip. The
postorbitals of NHCC LB13 have a larger exposure on the
skull roof than those of NMQR 1460 and overlap the
parietals more extensively, but given the otherwise great
degree of similarity between the specimens, we interpret
this as likely individual variation or preservation
differences.
NHCC LB14 is larger than NMQR 1460 (basal length
approximately 113 mm), and at the time of writing has only
been partially prepared. Part of a tusk is exposed on the
right side of the specimen, and empty alveoli for a tusk and
at least one ‘‘postcanine’’ are present on the left side.
Median anterior palatal ridges are absent, but the lateral
anterior ridges are well developed. The posterior median
palatal ridge also is present and bears a flattened expanded
anterior section similar to NHCC LB13. The posterior
median ridge is also flanked by rounded depressions. An
embayment of the palatal rim anterior to the caniniform
process is present, as is a postcaniniform keel. Only the left
palatine pad is exposed, but it has the same shape as that of
NHCC LB13 and is pierced by a palatal foramen. A median
nasal boss with a continuous posterior border is present on
the snout, and the pocket-like depression is well developed
on the lateral surface of the maxilla. The midfrontal suture
and the orbital margins are raised, and the postfrontals and
postorbitals are raised above the level of the frontals and
preparietal. The preparietal is triangular with raised edges
that continue posteriorly to meet with the raised lip that
surrounds the parietal foramen. The parietals are slightly
more exposed on the skull roof than in NHCC LB13, giving
this region an appearance more similar to that of NMQR
1460.
Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: None.
Previous Reports: Compsodon has not been reported
previously from the Luangwa Basin.

Identifying Characteristics: Angielczyk et al. (2005)
and Fröbisch and Reisz (2008) provided recent reviews of
diagnostic characters of Emydops. Both specimens are
small, possess an intertemporal region in which the parietals
are broadly exposed between the postorbitals, and display a
squared-off profile of the occiput in posterior view (better
exposed in BP/1/3347). The mandible is preserved in
NHCC LB15, and although unprepared, it is suggestive of
the presence of a prominent lateral dentary shelf and shovellike symphyseal region. Unfortunately, neither BP/1/3347
or NHCC LB15 is prepared enough at this time to determine
whether it represents Emydops arctatus, E. oweni, or a new
species.
Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: Emydops sp.
indet. (Fröbisch, 2009).
Previous Reports: Boonstra (1938) reported a fragmentary specimen with tusks and ‘‘postcanines’’ that he
tentatively identified as Emydops or Emydopsis. However,
as noted above, this specimen (SAM-PK-K7933) is most
likely Pristerodon. Drysdall and Kitching (1962, 1963) and
Kitching (1963) noted field observations of Emydops from
their Localities 3 and 17, which they considered part of the
lower and middle fossiliferous beds of the Madumabisa
Mudstone, respectively. Strangely, they did not mention
Emydops at Locality 4, despite the fact that the only identifiable Emydops specimen collected during that fieldwork
of which we are aware (BP/1/3347) is from Locality 4.
Anderson and Cruickshank (1978), King (1988, 1992),
Rubidge (2005), and Fröbisch (2009) included Emydops in
the faunal lists they presented, undoubtedly based on previous reports.

Identifying Characteristics: Angielczyk et al. (2009)
provided a revised diagnosis for the two valid species of
Dicynodontoides. NHMUK R15944 (Fig. 7.4h, j) is a
poorly preserved specimen that is preserved in a hematitic
nodule, and it has undergone only rudimentary preparation.
We refer the specimen to Dicynodontoides primarily based
on the absence of a postfrontal, the apparent occlusion of
the mandibular fenestra by a lamina of the dentary, and the
preserved anterior portion of the dentary seeming to be
consistent with the original presence of an elongate, shovelshaped symphysis. Our identification of NHCC LB16
(Fig. 7.4l) as Dicynodontoides is based on the absence of
median anterior ridges on the palate, the presence of lateral
anterior palatal ridges, the presence of a posterior median
ridge flanked by elongate depressions, the presence of an
embayment of the palatal rim anterior to the caniniform
process, the presence of a postcaniniform keel, the absence
of ‘‘postcanines,’’ the presence of very small, smooth palatine pads, and the absence of postfrontals on the skull roof.
NHCC LB17 (Fig. 7.4m) is a skull and lower jaw that are
preserved in a nodule. The nodule was recently burned
when collected, and appears to have split open during the
burning process, exposing a coronal section through the
palate. NHCC LB17 is tusked, and possesses the very long,
straight anterior pterygoid rami that are typical of Dicynodontoides (e.g., Fig. 7.4n). However, this identification
must remain tentative until the specimen is more fully
prepared. It is difficult to assign any of the specimens to one
of the two species of Dicynodontoides with certainty.
However, given that two of the three specimens are tuskless
and all are relatively large (particularly NHCC LB16) they
may be part of D. nowacki since that species seems to have
attained large sizes and was more frequently tuskless than
D. recurvidens (Angielczyk et al. 2009).
Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: None.
Previous Reports: Angielczyk et al. (2009) were the
first to report the presence of Dicynodontoides in the
Luangwa Basin, based on NHMUK R15944. Gale (1989)
referred an assemblage of juvenile dicynodonts to Dicynodon clarencei, a synonym of Dicynodontoides recurvidens
(Angielczyk et al. 2009). These specimens do not appear to

represent Dicynodontoides, but their exact identification is
uncertain (see above).

Material: BP/1/3337, BP/1/3591, BP/1/3603, NHCC
LB18, NHCC LB19. According to a handwritten note in the
BP collections by J.W. Kitching, dated October 6, 1992,
BP/1/3437 may represent a sixth specimen. However, we
have been unable to locate this specimen and assume that it
is lost.
Localities: Locality 4 of Drysdall and Kitching (1963)
(BP/1/3337, BP/1/3591, BP/1/3603), locality L53 (NHCC
LB18), locality L55 (NHCC LB19). BP/1/3437 was collected at Locality 5 of Drysdall and Kitching (1963).
Identifying Characteristics: Following Freeman
(1993), we consider these specimens to represent a new
cistecephalid taxon. Their cistecephalid affinities are indicated by their anteroposteriorly short skulls with broad
intertemporal regions, the presence of a stapedial foramen,
the absence of a preparietal, the absence of an interpterygoid vacuity, and large olecranon process of the ulna
(see Kammerer and Angielczyk 2009 for a compilation of
cistecephalid apomorphies). Freeman (1993) hypothesized
that the specimens represented a new species of Cistecephalus, but we are hesitant to endorse this conclusion
until the specimens are formally described and included in a
phylogenetic analysis. Nevertheless, they do appear to differ
in several ways from the three currently recognized cistecephalids, Cistecephalus microrhinus, Cistecephaloides
boonstrai, and Kawingasaurus fossilis.
The most obvious diagnostic character of the Zambian
cistecephalid is the presence of tusks, whereas all other
cistecephalid species are tuskless (e.g., Cox 1972; Keyser
1973b; Cluver 1974a). Three of the specimens (BP/1/3337,
BP/1/3591, and BP/1/3603) (Fig. 7.5f) possess tusks, one
specimen NHCC LB18 (Fig. 7.5e) possesses empty tusk
alveoli, and one specimen is tuskless (NHCC LB19)
(Fig. 7.5g). We suspect that the presence of empty alveoli in
NHCC LB18 likely represents a taphonomic artifact instead

of tooth replacement or another biological process, since
both specimens of Compsodon we collected feature empty
tusk or ‘‘postcanine’’ alveoli, and NHCC LB14 in particular
shows a preservation style that is extremely similar to
NHCC LB18. The absence of tusks in NHCC LB19 may
represent sexual dimorphism or another form of polymorphism. Such variability is not surprising given that several
other dicynodonts recently have been shown to be sexually
dimorphic or polymorphic for tusks (e.g., Angielczyk 2002;
Sullivan et al. 2003; Botha and Angielczyk 2007; Fröbisch
and Reisz 2008; Angielczyk et al. 2009), but a larger sample
of specimens will be needed to determine whether sexual
dimorphism is a likely cause.
The new Zambian cistecephalid can be further distinguished from Cistecephalus microrhinus by the absence of a
depression or notch on the ventral surface of the maxilla
lateral to the caniniform process (see Cluver 1974b), the
presence of a small, triangular, ventrally-directed flange on
the anterior pterygoid ramus, a mid-ventral vomerine plate
that is wide and trough-like anteriorly, and a more robust,
block-like crista oesophagea on the median pterygoid plate.
It can be distinguished from Cistecephaloides boonstrai by
the presence of a single embayment anterior to the caniniform process, the presence of a small, triangular, ventrallydirected flange on the anterior pterygoid ramus, a
mid-ventral vomerine plate that is wide and trough-like
anteriorly, a robust, block-like crista oesophagea on the
median pterygoid plate, a larger lateral dentary shelf, and the
absence of a tall cutting blade on the dorsal surface of the
dentary near the level of the lateral dentary shelf. Finally, it
can be distinguished from Kawingasaurus fossilis by larger
size, the presence of a small, triangular, ventrally-directed
flange on the anterior pterygoid ramus, a mid-ventral
vomerine plate that is wide and trough-like anteriorly, and a
robust, block-like crista oesophagea on the median pterygoid
plate. The only mandible of K. fossilis (GPIT K55f) is poorly
preserved, but the Zambian cistecephalid may additionally
differ from this species in the presence of a posterior dentary
sulcus and a larger lateral dentary shelf.

Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: Cistecephalus, Cistecephalus microrhinus, Cistecephalus planiceps
(Drysdall and Kitching 1962, 1963; Kitching 1963;
Anderson and Cruickshank 1978; Cooper 1982; King 1988,
1992; Smith and Keyser 1995; Lucas 2002, 2005, 2006;
Angielczyk 2002; Rubidge 2005; Fröbisch 2009).
Previous Reports: Drysdall and Kitching (1962, 1963)
and Kitching (1963) were the first to report Cistecephalus
from the Luangwa Basin. Specifically, they reported at least
13 specimens from localities in their middle and upper
fossiliferous beds, but most of these occurrences appear to
represent field identifications because they provided no
specimen numbers or photographs. The only Zambian
specimens in the BP collection that could be mistaken for
Cistecephalus are BP/1/3337, BP/1/3591, and BP/1/3603,
so we consider Drysdall and Kitching’s (1962, 1963) and
Kitching’s (1963) reports to instead represent this new
taxon. Numerous authors have cited Drysdall and
Kitching’s papers as a basis for including Cistecephalus in
the Zambian dicynodont fauna (Anderson and Cruickshank
1978; Cooper 1982; King 1988, 1992; Smith and Keyser
1995; Lucas 2002, 2005, 2006; Angielczyk 2002; Rubidge
2005; Fröbisch 2009), but only one author (Freeman 1993)
recognized that the specimens represented a new taxon.

Material: NHCC LB20.
Localities: Locality L59 (NHCC LB20).
Identifying Characteristics: NHCC LB20 consists of
the symphyseal region of a dicynodont jaw that was collected as float. It is noteworthy in possessing extremely
short dentary tables, dentary rami that strongly diverge
posteriorly, and an upturned anterior margin of the symphysis that forms a relatively thin edge (Fig. 7.5k, n). In
these characters, the specimen is very similar to the jaw of
Katumbia parringtoni (Fig. 7.5l; also see Angielczyk 2007),
but differs from jaws of most dicynodonts, which have

proportionally longer dentary tables (e.g., Oudenodon bainii; Fig. 7.5m, o). Therefore, we tentatively refer the
specimen to K. parringtoni, although confirmation of the

presence of this taxon in the fauna of the Upper Madumabisa Mudstone must await more complete and diagnostic material.

3586, BP/1/3587, BP/1/3589, NHCC LB24, SAM-PK11313. SAM-PK-K7936 also likely represents O. whaitsi,
although poor preservation of the specimen makes this
identification tentative.
Localities: Locality 4 of Drysdall and Kitching (1963)
(BP/1/3244, BP/1/3419, BP/1/3585, BP/1/3586, BP/1/3587,
BP/1/3589, SAM-PK-11313), locality L39 (NHCC LB24).
SAM-PK-K7936 was collected at Locality 3 of Drysdall
and Kitching (1963).
Identifying Characteristics: Boonstra (1938), Keyser
(1979), Keyser and Cruickshank (1979), and Angielczyk
(2002) provided diagnoses of O. whaitsi based primarily on
Zambian material, although Broom’s (1913) initial
description of the species was based on a South African
specimen. The most distinctive autapomorphies of
O. whaitsi are the elongate nasal bosses that extend from the
posterodorsal corner of the external nares to contact the
prefrontal bosses, and a concave dorsal surface of the snout
between the nasal bosses (Fig. 7.6a, b, g). All of the specimens listed above except SAM-PK-K7936 show this
character. Additional characters diagnostic of Odontocyclops include large size, variable presence of tusks, presence of a postcaniniform crest, absence of a labial fossa, and
a relatively narrow temporal bar in which the parietals are
well exposed between the postorbitals. SAM-PK-K7936
displays these characters, and the presence of tusks in that
specimen allow it to be differentiated from similarly-sized
Oudenodon specimens.
Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: Rhachiocephalus dubius, Odontocyclops dubius (Boonstra 1938;
Drysdall and Kitching 1963; Kitching 1963; Keyser 1979;
Keyser and Cruickshank 1979). Boonstra (1938) identified
SAM-PK-K7936 as Dicynodon cf. D. breviceps, and if this
specimen is indeed O. whaitsi, then this would be an
additional synonym. Cluver and King (1983) suggested that
Odontocyclops was likely a synonym of Dicynodon, and
King (1988) listed the genus Odontocyclops as synonym of
Dicynodon. However, she included the species Rhachiocephalus dubius Boonstra, 1938 as a synonym of Rhachiocephalus magnus, despite the fact that Keyser (1979)
and Keyser and Cruickshank (1979) used the former as the
type species of Odontocyclops. As noted below, at least
some of Kitching’s (1962, 1963) and Drysdall and
Kitching’s (1963) field reports of Aulacephalodon likely
represent Odontocyclops.

Previous Reports: Boonstra’s (1938) description of
‘‘Rhachiocephalus’’ dubius is the first report of O. whaitsi
from the Luangwa Basin. Drysdall and Kitching (1963),
Kitching (1963), Cooper (1982), Anderson and Cruickshank
(1978), Keyser (1979), Keyser and Cruickshank (1979),

NHCC LB23 was collected at locality L59. TSK 103 was
collected at Kerr’s (1974) Locality 11, and TSK 112 was
collected at Kerr’s (1974) Locality 13. The locality information for SAM-PK-K7943 and SAM-PK-K7947 is:
‘‘Probably from horizon in Upper Green Marls. About 1
! miles South of Mpundu. Horizon 4’’ (Boonstra 1938,
p. 37), which would correspond to Drysdall and Kitching’s
(1963) Locality 4. Specific locality information is not
available for SAM-PK-K7943; the SAM collections database only states that it is from the Luangwa Valley (S. Kaal,
personal communication, 2010).
Identifying Characteristics: Keyser (1975), Cluver and
Hotton (1981), and Botha and Angielczyk (2007) are the
most detailed recent papers to address the ways in which
Oudenodon bainii can be differentiated from other dicynodonts, and we follow the latter’s hypothesis that Zambian Oudenodon specimens most likely represent O. bainii
and not a distinct species. The Zambian specimens we refer
to O. bainii vary widely in the quality of their preservation
and the degree to which they have been prepared. The
following characters are ones we focused on for identifying
O. bainii specimens, although not all are preserved or visible in all specimens: medium size; thin ridge present on
anterior surface of premaxilla; paired nasal bosses that are
rounded and overhang the external nares; pineal boss
absent; temporal bar in which the parietals are exposed
between the postorbitals and are often slightly depressed
relative to the postorbitals; tusks and ‘‘postcanines’’ absent;

postcaniniform crest present; labial fossa surrounded by the
palatine, maxilla, and jugal absent; palatal surface of the
palatine possesses raised rugose posterior section and a
smoother anterior section that is flush with the secondary
palate; interpterygoid vacuity relatively long, reaching the
level of the palatal surface of the palatines; mid-ventral
plate of vomer narrow and blade-like in ventral view; intertuberal ridge between basioccipital tubera absent.
Keyser (1975) provided a detailed justification for why
the holotypes of four species described by Boonstra (1938)
(SAM-PK-11301, type of Dicynodon luangwanensis
(Fig. 7.7j, n); SAM-PK-11312, type of Dicynodon helenae;
SAM-PK-11316, type of Dicynodon euryceps; SAM-PK11319, type of Dicynodon parabreviceps) are best regarded
as part of Oudenodon. He favored retaining them as a
species (O. luangwanensis) distinct from South African
O. bainii on account of the wide zygomatic arches that give
the skull a heart shape in dorsal view. We do not consider
this to be a valid diagnostic character because a similar
morphology can be found among South African specimens
(Fig. 7.7o), and the morphometric results of Botha and
Angielczyk (2007) are consistent with the presence of only
one species.
The remaining specimens show varying numbers of the
characters listed above depending on the quality of their
preservation and the degree to which they have been prepared (e.g., compare Fig. 7.7j–m). For example, TSK 67 is
extremely well preserved and completely prepared, and it
shows all of the diagnostic characters listed above
(Fig. 7.7k, l, m). TSK 101 is a nearly complete skull, but it
is mostly unprepared. Nevertheless, it possesses a thin snout
ridge, rounded nasal bosses, and a temporal bar in which the
parietals are exposed but depressed below the level of the
postorbitals; tusks are absent, but a postcaniniform crest is
present. NHCC LB21 also is relatively complete, but even
though it is entirely unprepared, the snout ridge, nasal
bosses, temporal bar, and caniniform processes are

sufficiently visible to confirm that it is O. bainii. TSK 69
consists only of a snout, but it is well-prepared, and paired,
rounded nasal bosses, a median snout ridge, palatines with
rugose posterior surfaces and smoother, flush anterior surfaces, postcaniniform crest, and absence of tusks can all be
easily observed. Finally, TSK 103 and NHCC LB23 are
examples of specimens that can only be tentatively identified as O. bainii. TSK 103 is a well preserved and prepared
occiput that includes part of the temporal bar and part of the
zygomatic portion of the squamosal. The size of the specimen and the morphology of the preserved portion of the
temporal bar are consistent with it representing O. bainii,
but it presents too few diagnostic features to confirm its
identity. Likewise, NHCC LB23 is a fragmentary, unprepared snout. The specimen is tuskless, and the general
shapes of the snout and caniniform process are consistent
with O. bainii, but additional preparation would be necessary to confirm this identification.
Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: Dicynodon
lutriceps, Dicynodon cf. breviceps, Dicynodon corstorphinei, Dicynodon cf. corstorphinei, Dicynodon cf. milletti,
Dicynodon latirostris, Dicynodon luangwanensis, Dicynodon helenae, Dicynodon euryceps, Dicynodon parabreviceps, Oudenodon luangwanensis (Boonstra 1938; Drysdall
and Kitching 1963; Kitching 1963; Keyser 1975; Fröbisch
2008, 2009). The majority of these species are based on
types from the Karoo Basin of South Africa, and justifications of these synonymies can be found in Keyser (1975).
Two misspellings of the species name luangwanensis
Boonstra, 1938 are commonly used in the literature with the
genus name Oudenodon: O. luangwaensis (Drysdall and
Kitching 1963; Kitching 1963; Keyser 1972, 1975; Cluver
and Hotton 1981; Jacobs et al. 2005) and O. luangwensis
(King 1988; Botha and Angielczyk 2007).

of material from the Luangwa Basin that was eventually
referred to O. bainii. Drysdall and Kitching (1962, 1963),

Angielczyk (2002), Rubidge (2005), and Fröbisch (2009) all
mentioned the presence of Oudenodon in the Luangwa
Basin, although Drysdall and Kitching (1963) and Kitching
(1963) primarily did so using synonyms.

Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: Strictly
speaking, there are no synonyms of Kitchinganomodon
crassus in the Luangwa Basin literature. However,
Angielczyk and Kurkin (2003), Angielczyk (2007), and
Angielczyk and Rubidge (2010) included TSK 23 among
the Rhachiocephalus specimens they consulted for character
state codings in their phylogenetic analyses.
Previous Reports: There are no previous reports of
Kitchinganomodon crassus from Zambia.

Rhachiocephalidae Maisch, 2000
Kitchinganomodon crassus Maisch, 2002a
Figure 7.7a, c, f, h
Material: TSK 23.
Localities: Kerr’s (1974) Locality 2 (TSK 23).
Identifying Characteristics: Maisch (2002a; also see
Maisch 1999) erected the genus Kitchinganomodon and
identified characters that can be used to distinguish
K. crassus from Rhachiocephalus magnus. Among Maisch’s (2002a) characters, TSK 23 possesses broadened
anterior pterygoid rami, a wide, robust snout, and large
nasal bosses that are located directly above the external
nares. A rod of bone that seems to be formed by the vomer
also extends along the midline of the interpterygoid vacuity,
much like the condition in K. crassus that Maisch (2002a)
described as closure of the interpterygoid vacuity by the
vomer. Maisch’s (2002a) remaining diagnostic characters
are difficult to assess because of preservation, but TSK 23 is
suggestive of the presence of at least some of these (e.g., the
extensive ossification of the lateral wall of the braincase). In
addition, the overall shape of the skull of TSK 23
(Fig. 7.7a), especially in dorsal view, shows a strong
resemblance to the type of K. crassus (Fig. 7.7b). Finally,
the shape of the mandible in lateral view in TSK 23
(Fig. 7.7c) is much more similar to K. crassus (Fig. 7.7d)
than that of R. magnus (Fig. 7.7e). The symphyseal region
of the dentary is much deeper than the postdentary bones in
TSK 23 and RC 88 (the holotype of K. crassus), with the
ventral and posterior edges of the symphyseal region
meeting in a sharp corner. In contrast, although symphyseal
region of R. magnus also is deeper than the postdentary
bones, the disparity is not as marked, and the posterior and
ventral edges form a much more obtuse angle.

Dicynodontoidea (Owen, 1860a)
Dicynodon huenei Haughton, 1932
Figure 7.8a–c, e, g, i–k, m, n
Material: TSK 14, TSK 27, TSK 37. TSK 40 may
represent D. huenei, but is mostly unprepared. TSK 83
includes several juvenile specimens that were described by
Gale (1988) and referred to Diictodon, but this identification
has been questioned (Angielczyk and Sullivan 2008; also
see above). Dicynodon huenei may be a better identification
but is somewhat tentative because independent data on the
earliest ontogenetic stages of this taxon are unavailable.
Three specimens in the NHMUK that were collected by the
1963 expedition (field numbers 5-2, 5-4, 5-10) may represent D. huenei, but these specimens are unprepared.
Localities: Kerr’s (1974) Locality 1 (TSK 14), Kerr’s
(1974) Locality 3 (TSK 27, TSK 37). TSK 40 was collected
at Kerr’s (1974) Locality 7. TSK 83 was collected at
‘‘Locality 14.’’ This may correspond to Kerr’s (1974)
Locality 6 (because the locality is described as producing
several small dicynodont skulls in that reference), but this is
uncertain. The NHMUK specimens with field numbers were
collected at Locality 5 of Drysdall and Kitching (1963).
Identifying Characteristics: Kammerer et al. (2011)
discussed the basis for recognizing Dicynodon huenei as a
distinct and valid species. TSK 14 was described in detail by
King (1981), and she referred the specimen to Dicynodon
trigonocephalus. Kammerer et al. (2011) concluded that the
holotype of D. trigonocephalus (RC 38) is a somewhat distorted juvenile of Dicynodon lacerticeps, and that D. lacerticeps and D. huenei are closely related. Two of the primary
distinguishing features of D. huenei are an autapomorphic

114

thickening of the zygomatic arch, such that the structure
appears somewhat flattened in lateral view, and twisting and
widening of the postorbital bar, such that its distal end forms
a mediolaterally-oriented, flattened plate on the zygomatic
arch. Together, these characteristics give the suborbital
portion of the face a wide, flattened appearance in anterior
view (e.g., Fig. 7.8g). TSK 14 displays all of these characters, and also shows a strong resemblance to other specimens
of D. huenei in other respects (e.g., CAMZM T1089;
Fig. 7.8d, f, h, l). TSK 27 (Fig. 7.8j) is mostly unprepared,
but the left zygomatic arch is well exposed, showing the
autapomorphic thickening of the zygomatic arch typical of
D. huenei. TSK 37 (Fig. 7.8k) consists of a relatively well
preserved but somewhat unprepared skull, jaw, and portions
of the postcranial skeleton. The skull resembles that of other
D. huenei specimens, including in the presence of a thickened
zygoma, and the postcranial elements are also comparable to
other D. huenei material (e.g., Fig. 7.8m, n, o). TSK 40 is a
nearly unprepared skull preserved in a broken nodule, but a
thickened zygoma is apparent. Specimen 5-2 (Fig. 7.8c) and
5-4 are incomplete and unprepared, but both have portions of
their temporal bars exposed. These show extensive overlap of
the postorbitals by the parietals, a morphology most consistent with D. huenei among Zambian dicynodonts. Specimen
5-10 (Fig. 7.8b) is somewhat more complete, and appears to
have originally possessed a plate-like zygomatic arch and
postorbital bar, although these areas are currently not well
preserved. Although their poor preservation makes their
identification somewhat tentative, these three specimens are
important data points for establishing D. huenei in the
northern part of the Luangwa Basin.
Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: Dicynodon
lacerticeps, Dicynodon trigonocephalus, ‘‘Dicynodon’’
trigonocephalus (Boonstra 1938; Drysdall and Kitching
1963; Kitching 1963; King 1981, 1988; King and Jenkins
1997; Fröbisch 2008, 2009).
Previous Reports: Boonstra (1938) reported a fragmentary specimen consisting of an occiput and an intertemporal bar in which the postorbitals strongly overlapped
the parietals. He referred this specimen to Dicynodon
lacerticeps, and referred to it by the field number R.40.
None of the catalogued Zambian material at the SAM has
this field number associated with it (S. Kaal, personal
communication, 2011), so we were unable to examine the
specimen. Although Boonstra’s description is not detailed
enough to definitively state whether the specimen is
D. lacerticeps or D. huenei, we regard the most parsimonious interpretation of this report as the latter species.
Drysdall and Kitching (1962, 1963) and Kitching (1963)
also reported Dicynodon from the Luangwa Basin, but most
of these reports represent Diictodon or Oudenodon instead
(see above). Drysdall and Kitching’s (1963) and Kitching’s
(1963) specific mentions of Dicynodon lacerticeps are only

repetitions of Boonstra’s (1938) original report. Anderson
and Cruickshank (1978), Cooper (1982), King (1988, 1992),
and Rubidge (2005) all noted the presence of Dicynodon in
Zambia, but did not refer to a particular species. King’s
(1981) paper focused on the skeletal morphology and
function of TSK 14, but she did note the Zambian origin of
the specimen and referred it to D. trigonocephalus. King
and Jenkins (1997) also mentioned the presence of
D. trigonocephalus in the Luangwa Basin as part of the
biostratigraphic context for their putative specimen of
Lystrosaurus. In the taxonomic framework used here, both
of these reports should be considered to represent D. huenei.
Lucas (1997, 1998a, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2009) used the
occurrence of Dicynodon in the Luangwa Basin as part of
his tetrapod biochronology for the Permian, but in most
cases did not explicitly discuss any particular species of the
genus. He does mention D. trigonocephalus in Lucas (1997,
1998a) following King (1981), and his later citations of
King and Jenkins (1997) would imply that his usage focuses
on this species as well (here recognized as D. huenei; see
above and Kammerer et al. 2011). However, the locality he
gives [e.g., ‘‘‘Horizon 5’ of Boonstra in the Luangwa Valley, 4.8–6.4 km north of Nt’awere, Zambia’’ (Lucas 2006,
p. 83; also see Lucas 1997, 1998a, 2001)] corresponds to the
type locality of Dicynodon roberti, a junior synonym of
Syops vanhoepeni (see Kammerer et al. 2011, and below).
Fröbisch (2009) regarded four species of Dicynodon sensu
lato as potentially valid and occurring in the Luangwa
Basin: D. lacerticeps, ‘‘D.’’ trigonocephalus, ‘‘D.’’ roberti,
and ‘‘D.’’ vanhoepeni. The first two of these correspond to
material we assign to D. huenei.
Syops vanhoepeni (Boonstra, 1938)
Figure 7.9a–i
Material: NHCC LB25, SAM-PK-11311, SAM-PK11325a, SAM-PK-11325b.
Localities: Locality 4 of Drysdall and Kitching (1963)
(SAM-PK-11311), Locality 5 of Drysdall and Kitching
(1963) (SAM-PK-11325a, SAM-PK-11325b), locality L61
(NHCC LB25).
Identifying Characteristics: Kammerer et al. (2011)
discuss the basis for recognizing Syops vanhoepeni as a
valid species and the rationale for considering D. roberti to
be its junior synonym. The four specimens of S. vanhoepeni
are unprepared, but enough morphology is exposed in each
to allow them to be grouped together confidently. All four
possess a similar long, low snout profile, large external
nares, caniniform processes with a postcaniniform crest, and
large, robust tusks. SAM-PK-11325a and NHCC LB25 also
share a unique pattern of ornamentation on the dorsal surface of the snout: a thick, rounded median ridge that is
flanked laterally by shallow depressions, which in turn are
bounded laterally by elongate, ridge-like nasal bosses

(Fig. 7.9a, b). The snout region is more poorly preserved in
SAM-PK-11311 and SAM-PK-11325b, making it impossible to confirm whether these specimens had the same pattern of ornamentation, but part of a median ridge is
preserved on the premaxilla of SAM-PK-11325b. NHCC
LB25 and SAM-PK-11325b (e.g., Fig. 7.9d) also share a
relatively narrow intertemporal bar in which the postorbitals
extensively overlap the parietals, but this portion of the
skull is not preserved in SAM-PK-11325a or SAM-PK11311. Syops vanhoepeni shows a number of superficial
similarities to Odontocyclops and Kitchinganomodon, but
can be differentiated from both even with the fragmentary
material currently available. Syops vanhoepeni can be distinguished from Odontocyclops based on the latter taxon’s
much more concave dorsal snout surface, absence of a
strong median ridge on the dorsal surface of the snout, and
wider exposure of the parietals between the postorbitals on
the temporal bar. Syops vanhoepeni differs from Kitchinganomodon crassus in possessing tusks, more elongate nasal
bosses, a wide rounded median ridge on the dorsal surface
of the snout, and the absence of a pineal boss.
Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: Dicynodon
vanhoepeni, Dicynodon roberti (Boonstra 1938; King
1988); ‘‘Dicynodon’’ vanhoepeni, ‘‘Dicynodon’’ roberti
(Fröbisch 2008, 2009).
Previous Reports: Boonstra (1938) described Dicynodon
vanhoepeni and D. roberti. Drysdall and Kitching (1963)
included both D. vanhoepeni and D. roberti in their list of
taxa reported from the Luangwa Basin, but Kitching (1963)
only included D. vanhoepeni. King (1988) listed both species
in the systematic section of her monograph, but only included
the genus Dicynodon without reference to particular species
in her faunal list for Zambia. Anderson and Cruickshank
(1978), King (1992), and Rubidge (2005) also only included
the genus Dicynodon without reference to particular species.
As noted above, at least some of the material referred to the
genus Dicynodon by Lucas (1997, 1998a, 2001, 2002, 2005,
2006, 2009) and used in his tetrapod biochronology corresponds to specimens of S. vanhoepeni. Fröbisch (2009; also
see Fröbisch 2008) included both D. vanhoepeni and
D. roberti in his compilation, but noted that their validity had
not been reassessed since their description.
Permian Dicynodonts Whose Presence in Zambia Cannot be Confirmed
Pachytegos stockleyi Haughton, 1932
Previous Reports: King (1988) included Pachytegos in
her faunal list for Zambia. However, we are aware of no
other reports of Pachytegos from Zambia and suspect this is
an error since Pachytegos is not included in her faunal list
for Tanzania, despite the fact that the only published
material attributed to the taxon originated in Tanzania
(Haughton 1932; Cox 1964; Gay and Cruickshank 1999).

K. D. Angielczyk et al.

Cistecephalus microrhinus Owen, 1876
Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: Cistecephalus planiceps (Drysdall and Kitching 1963; Kitching 1963).
Keyser (1973b) discusses the synonymy of C. planiceps and
C. microrhinus.
Previous Reports: Drysdall and Kitching (1962, 1963)
and Kitching (1963) were the first authors to report specimens of Cistecephalus in the Luangwa Basin. Several
additional authors subsequently cited these records, primarily in biogeographic and biostratigraphic contexts
(Anderson and Cruickshank 1978; Cooper 1982; King 1988,
1992; Smith and Keyser 1995; Lucas 2002, 2005, 2006;
Angielczyk 2002; Rubidge 2005; Fröbisch 2009). However,
as noted above, Drysdall and Kitching did not provide
photographs of or specimen numbers for any of their
Cistecephalus records. Because all Zambian cistecephalid
material available in collections appears to be referable to a
new taxon (see above), we consider there to be no reliable
evidence of Cistecephalus in the Luangwa Basin at this time.
Tropidostoma microtrema (Seeley, 1889)
Previous Reports: Drysdall and Kitching (1963) and
Kitching (1963) stated that they collected specimens of Dicynodon acutirostris in Zambia, a species that Keyser
(1973a) and Botha and Angielczyk (2007) considered to be a
junior synonym of Tropidostoma microtrema. Based on this
taxonomic change, Fröbisch (2009) included Tropidostoma
in the dicynodont fauna of the Madumabisa Mudstone in
Zambia. Keyser (1981) also stated that Tropidostoma was
present in the Luangwa Basin. The type of D. acutirostris was
collected in South Africa, and we have not identified any
Zambian specimens in our search of museum collections or
our fieldwork that can be referred to T. microtrema. Drysdall
and Kitching (1963) and Kitching (1963) did not provide
numbers for any of the specimens they identified as D. acutirostris, so the accuracy of their identification cannot be
checked. Therefore, because there are no voucher specimens
documenting the presence of T. microtrema (=T. dubium; see
Kammerer et al. 2011), it should not be included in the
Permian dicynodont fauna of the Luangwa Basin.
Rhachiocephalus magnus (Owen, 1876)
Previous Reports: Boonstra (1938) was the first to refer
a Zambian dicynodont specimen to Rhachiocephalus (the
holotype of Rhachiocephalus dubius). Keyser (1975)
included this species in his taxonomic review but hinted that
the specimens in question may represent a distinct taxon, an
observation that was confirmed with the erection of
Odontocyclops (Keyser 1979; Keyser and Cruickshank
1979; Angielczyk 2002). Drysdall and Kitching (1963) and
Kitching (1963) reported Neomegacyclops and Platycyclops, now recognized as junior synonyms of Rhachiocephalus (Keyser 1975; Cluver and King 1983; also see

7

Zambian Dicynodont Faunas

Maisch 2002a). Anderson and Cruickshank (1978), King
(1988, 1992), and Fröbisch (2009) included Rhachiocephalus in their faunal tabulations for the Luangwa Basin following Drysdall and Kitching (1963). However, Drysdall
and Kitching’s (1963) and Kitching’s (1963) reports of
Rhachiocephalus appear to be based on field observations,
and we know of no voucher specimens that can confirm the
presence of this taxon in Zambia. The best potential candidate (TSK 23) instead represents Kitchinganomodon.
Therefore we cannot include Rhachiocephalus in the fauna
of the Madumabisa Mudstone at this time.
Haughtoniana magna Boonstra, 1938
Figure 7.9j
Material: SAM-PK-11321.
Localities: Locality 4 of Drysdall and Kitching (1963)
(SAM-PK-11321).
Identifying Characteristics: The holotype of Haughtoniana magna consists of fragmentary cranial and postcranial material of a large dicynodont. Boonstra (1938) erected
the species primarily on the basis of the construction of the
intertemporal bar. In particular, he noted that the postorbitals
were wide, nearly horizontal, and in the same plane as the
parietals; the parietals were relatively narrow; and the
interparietal extended onto the dorsal surface of the skull
roof (Fig. 7.9j). Keyser (1975) and Cluver and King (1983)
considered it to be a likely nomen dubium, and King (1988)
also cast doubt on its validity, although she suggested it
might be referable to Aulacephalodon. We agree that the
type of H. magna is too fragmentary to allow a definitive
identification, either as a valid species or as a synonym of
another species. Moreover, the temporal bar fragment
appears to have lost some of its original bone surface, either
through weathering or preparation in which the hematitic
matrix was not removed cleanly from the bone. We suggest
that this may account for the fact that the parietals and
postorbitals are in the same plane and potentially explains
the oddly-shaped exposure of the interparietal on the skull
roof. The general size and appearance of the type is similar
to the temporal bar of Odontocyclops (e.g., BP/1/3419;
Fig. 7.6b), although uncertainty about whether the exposure
of the interparietal on the skull roof is real or an artifact
prevents the definitive identification of H. magna as a synonym of O. whaitsi (the interparietal is not exposed on the
skull roof in O. whaitsi; Angielczyk 2002).
Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: None.
Previous Reports: Boonstra (1938) described Haughtoniana magna, and Drysdall and Kitching (1963) and
Kitching (1963) noted its occurrence in the Luangwa Basin.
Keyser (1975), Cluver and King (1983), and King (1988)
considered it in their systematic treatments, and King
(1988) also included it in her faunal list for Zambia.
Fröbisch (2009) also mentioned H. magna, but noted that its

117

taxonomic status was uncertain and did not include it in his
final faunal list for Zambia.
Aulacephalodon bainii (Owen, 1845)
Figure 7.9k
Previous Reports: Drysdall and Kitching (1962, 1963)
and Kitching (1963) were the first to report Aulacephalodon,
including the species A. laticeps (a synonym of
A. bainii; see Cluver and King 1983) from the Luangwa Basin.
The records appear to represent field identifications of specimens from at least their Localities 1 and 4 because no specimen
numbers for collected material were cited. Kitching (1963)
also used the name Aulacocephalodon, which is an oftenrepeated misspelling of Aulacephalodon (Tollman et al. 1980).
Several subsequent authors included Aulacephalodon in the
Zambian dicynodont fauna based on these reports (Anderson
and Cruickshank 1978; Cooper 1982; King 1988, 1992; Angielczyk 2002; Fröbisch 2009). However, in our examination
of material in collections, we found no specimens that can be
positively identified as Aulacephalodon. BP/1/3242, a specimen originating at Drysdall and Kitching’s Locality 1 that is
identified in the BP catalogue as Aulacephalodon, is completely unprepared (Fig. 7.9k) and displays no characters
allowing it to be identified. King’s (1988) suggestion that
Haughtoniana magna might represent Aulacephalodon also is
likely incorrect (see above). We did not observe any specimens
that could be positively identified as Aulacephalodon during
our fieldwork, and we suspect that previous reports likely
represent Odontocyclops specimens, Syops vanhoepeni specimens, or large Oudenodon specimens that were misidentified
in the field. Therefore, Aulacephalodon should not be included
in faunal lists for the Madumabisa Mudstone.
Dicynodon lissops Broom, 1913
Previous Reports: Drysdall and Kitching (1963) stated
that Dicynodon lissops was among a collection of four small
anomodonts collected at their Locality 21, but provided no
figures of or specimen numbers for this material. The holotype
of Dicynodon lissops (AMNH 5508) is from the Dicynodon
Assemblage Zone of South Africa, and was considered a junior
synonym of Daptocephalus leoniceps by Kammerer et al.
(2011). Given that this would be the only known occurrence of
Daptocephalus from the Luangwa Basin of Zambia, we are
hesitant to consider the report valid due to the lack of voucher
specimens. Therefore we recommend that Dicynodon lissops
and its senior synonym Daptocephalus leoniceps be excluded
from the dicynodont fauna of the Luangwa Basin until positively identifiable material comes to light.
Dicynodon rhodesiensis
Previous Reports: Boonstra (1938, p. 384) included the
name D. rhodesiensis in a list of Dicynodon species from
Zambia. However, he does not mention or describe the
species elsewhere in the paper, and we are unaware of any

mention of the species in the literature before or after this
aside from Drysdall and Kitching’s (1963) and Kitching’s
(1963) inclusion of the species in their lists of dicynodonts
reported previously from the basin. Therefore, we conclude
that the inclusion of the name must have been a mistake or
oversight by Boonstra, and no species of this name was ever
described from Zambia or elsewhere.

(King and Jenkins 1997, p. 152). This corresponds to Kerr’s
(1974) Locality 1 (also see Davies, 1981).
Identifying Characteristics: In their discussion of TSK
2, King and Jenkins (1997) listed a shortened basicranial
axis, exposure of the parietals between the postorbitals on
the skull roof, the deepened, ventrally-angled snout, the
smooth premaxilla-maxilla suture, the extension of the
premaxilla to the level of the prefrontals, and the pear
shaped external naris bounded posteroventrally by a rugose
ridge as characters that were typical of Lystrosaurus. They
also suggested that the smoothly curving snout profile, the
absence of a nasofrontal ridge and ornamentation on the
frontals, the absence of strong prefrontal bosses, and a laterally flared squamosal implied the specimen most closely

Zambian Dicynodont Faunas

resembled L. curvatus since these characters were included
in diagnoses of L. curvatus available at the time (e.g.,
Cluver 1971; Cosgriff et al. 1982). They also have been
included in diagnoses of L. curvatus in subsequent works
dealing with the species composition of Lystrosaurus (e.g.,
Ray 2005; Grine et al. 2006; Botha and Smith 2007).
Although we agree that the TSK 2 shows some features
similar to Lystrosaurus, and L. curvatus in particular, there
are other characters that do not fit well with this identification and seem to fall outside of the ranges of intraspecific
and intrageneric variation identified by authors such as Ray
(2005) or Grine et al. (2006). For example, TSK 2 possesses
an ectopterygoid, whereas the ectopterygoid is absent in
Lystrosaurus (Cluver 1971) and recent authors have not
identified this as a variable character within the taxon.
Similarly, although the parietals are exposed between the
postorbitals on the skull roof, the exposure is narrower than
typical in Lystrosaurus, and the temporal bar is relatively
longer anteroposteriorly in TSK 2 (e.g., compare
Fig. 7.10a–e). The latter character is especially interesting
because both Ray (2005) and Grine et al. (2006) noted that
the temporal region displays negative allometry in Lystrosaurus. NMQR 3595 (L. curvatus; Fig. 7.10e) is consistent
with this pattern, with the temporal bar being approximately
9 % of the basal length of the skull. In contrast, the temporal bar is approximately 21 % of the basal skull length in
TSK 2 (Fig. 7.10a), despite the two specimens having
nearly identical basal skull lengths. The frontal region,
although slightly damaged in TSK 2, appears to have been
narrower than typical in L. curvatus. This also is inconsistent with TSK 2 being part of Lystrosuarus because Ray
(2005) and Grine et al. (2006) found that this measurement
was isometric to positively allometric. The snout is angled
ventrally in TSK 2, but the angle of deflection is less than in
L. curvatus and it does not extend as far downwards (e.g.,
compare Fig. 7.10c–g). TSK 2 also lacks most of the conspicuous skull ornamentation in Lystrosaurus, such as a
sagittal ridge on the premaxilla or a prefrontal nasal crest.
Although these characters tend to be weakly developed in
L. curvatus (Grine et al. 2006) and show evidence of sexual
dimorphism (Ray 2005), their complete absence in a relatively large specimen specimen such as TSK 2 (basal length
approximately 144 mm) is surprising. These characters
usually manifest in specimens with basal lengths in the
range of 80–100 mm and are present in at least some
L. curvatus specimens with sizes comparable to TSK 2
(Grine et al. 2006). Taken together, the differences between
TSK 2 and definite specimens of L. curvatus (and other
Lystrosaurus) species do not appear consistent with patterns
of ontogenetic variation or sexual dimorphism identified by
previous authors. Because of this, as well as the fact that a
ventrally-extended snout is present in other dicynodonts
such as Kwazulusaurus shakai, Euptychognathus

119

bathyrhynchus, and Basilodon woodwardi (Maisch 2002b;
Kammerer et al. 2011), we do not think that TSK 2 can be
identified unequivocally as Lystrosaurus curvatus or even
Lystrosaurus. It may instead represent a new taxon (likely a
lystrosaurid; see Kammerer et al. 2011), and it should be
possible to collect additional material to characterize this
taxon more fully. For example, Fig. 7.10d shows a specimen that we observed in 2009 but did not collect that has a
relatively long, downturned snout and a narrow temporal
region.
Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: None.
Previous Reports: King and Jenkins (1997) were the
first to report Lystrosaurus from the Luangwa Basin, and
the occurrence was noted in other compilations examining
therapsid biogeography (Angielczyk and Kurkin 2003;
Rubidge 2005; Fröbisch 2009). It also was cited in a number
of papers considering biostratigraphic correlations between
the Luangwa and other basins (e.g., Lucas 1998b, 2006;
Gay and Cruickshank 1999; Ray 1999; Catuneanu et al.
2005), as well as in studies of the end-Permian extinction
and the origin and survivorship of Lystrosaurus during that
event (e.g., Rubidge and Sidor 2001; Maisch 2002b; Botha
and Smith 2006, 2007; Fröbisch 2007, 2008; Lucas 2009).

processes, tusks, a crest-like temporal bar that forms a sharp
angle with the interorbital region, an anteriorly-sloping
occipital plate, limited facial exposure of the lacrimal, the
presence of a labial fossa, and the absence of an ectopterygoid. In addition, they differentiated K. lophorhinus
from K. simocephalus on the basis of a more robust skull, a
stronger median ridge on the snout that is flanked by
depressions, a deeper, wider snout, larger caniniform processes, a broader intertemporal region, shorter temporal
openings and secondary palate, and the absence of a fossa
on the ventral surface of the median pterygoid plate, among
other characters. Although BP/1/3638 is not completely
preserved, most of Renaut et al.’s (2003) diagnostic characters are visible on the specimen, and the robust snout,
strong median snout ridge, and large caniniform processes
are especially apparent (Fig. 7.11a–c).
Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: Rechnisaurus
cristarhynchus, Rechnisaurus, Kannemeyeria cristarhynchus, Kannemeyeria. Renaut et al. (2003; also see Renaut
2000) provided an excellent review of the complex taxonomic history of BP/1/3638. In her initial description,
Crozier (1970) referred the specimen to Rechnisaurus
cristarhynchus Roy Chowdhury, 1970, with Keyser
(1973c), Battail (1978, 1993), and Ochev and Shishkin
(1989) following this identification. Keyser (1974) expressed uncertainty about whether R. cristarhynchus (including
BP/1/3638) was distinct from Kannemeyeria and Keyser
and Cruickshank (1979) elaborated this argument, concluding that it should be treated as a species of Kannemeyeria (K. cristarhynchus). A number of authors followed
this taxonomy (Anderson and Cruickshank 1978; Cooper
1980, 1982; Cox and Li 1983; Cruickshank 1986;
Bandyopadhyay 1988). However, Bandyopadhyay (1985,
1989) argued that the Indian holotype of Rechnisaurus
cristarhynchus Roy Chowdhury, 1970 could not be assigned
to Kannemeyeria and was distinct from the Namibian and
Zambian specimens that Keyser and Cruickshank (1979)
considered. She retained R. cristarhynchus Roy Chowdhury,
1970 for the Indian specimen, and used the name ‘‘Kannemeyeria cristarhynchus (Crozier, 1970; Keyser and Cruickshank, 1979)’’ for the Namibian and Zambian specimens.
King (1988) followed this taxonomy, although she referred
to the Zambian and Namibian specimens as ‘‘Kannemeyeria
cristarhynchus Keyser and Cruickshank, 1979’’ and erroneously stated that Keyser and Cruickshank used the
emended spelling ‘‘cristarhyncha.’’ King (1990), Cox
(1991), Renaut (2000), and Renaut and Hancox (2001) used
the name K. cristarhynchus for the Zambian and Namibian
specimens and accepted that they were distinct from Rechnisaurus, although Lucas (1993b, 1996, 1998b, 1999,
2001, 2010; also see Lucas and Wild 1995) argued repeatedly for their synonymy. Renaut et al. (2003) argued that
the name Kannemeyeria cristarhynchus violated Article 49

121

of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and
coined the new species name Kannemeyeria lophorhinus as
its replacement. Abdala et al. (2005) and Fröbisch (2008,
2009) used the name Kannemeyeria lophorhinus.
Previous Reports: Crozier (1970) was the first to formally describe and figure BP/1/3638, but the specimen is
one of two ‘‘Kannemeyeria-like’’ dicynodonts that Drysdall
and Kitching (1963) and Kitching (1963) mentioned collecting at Locality 16 (also see Brink 1963; Cox 1969; note
that Chernin 1974 mistakenly reported these specimens as
originating in the upper fossiliferous horizon at Drysdall and
Kitching’s (1963) Locality 15). Keyser (1974), Keyser and
Cruickshank (1979), Cox and Li (1983), Bandyopadhyay
(1985, 1988, 1989), King (1988), Renaut (2000), Renaut and
Hancox (2001), and Renaut et al. (2003) discussed various
aspects of the taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships of
BP/1/3638 using various names. Many authors noted the
presence of Kannemeyeria ‘‘cristarhynchus,’’ K. lophorhinus, or more generally Kannemeyeria in Zambia in a biogeographic or biostratigraphic framework (Keyser 1973c,
1981; Anderson and Cruickshank 1978; Cooper 1980, 1982;
Cruickshank 1986; King 1988, 1990; Cox 1991; Lucas
1993b, 1996, 1998b, 1999, 2001, 2010; Lucas and Wild
1995; Abdala et al. 2005; Fröbisch 2009; although note that
Keyser 1981 erroneously reported the occurrence in the
Upper Madumabisa Mudstone). Battail (1978, 1993) and
Ochev and Shishkin (1989) also considered the biostratigraphic implications of BP/1/3638, but used the name Rechnisaurus. Battail (1993) also mistakenly reported that it
occurred in the upper horizon of the Ntawere Formation. The
studies of DeFauw (1989), and Fröbisch (2008) are more
evolutionary in focus, but they do mention Kannemeyeria
from Zambia. Finally, it is important to note that even
though BP/1/3638 was initially referred to Rechnisaurus by
Crozier (1970) and BP/1/3636 (see below) was referred to
Kannemeyeria in the same paper, the rapid reassignment of
these specimens to Kannemeyeria and Dolichuranus
(respectively) means that nearly all subsequent literature
reports of Kannemeyeria from Zambia refer to BP/1/3638,
not BP/1/3636.
‘‘Kannemeyeria’’ latirostris Crozier, 1970
Figure 7.11e–i
Material: BP/1/3636.
Localities: Locality 16 of Drysdall and Kitching (1963)
(BP/1/3636). This locality is in Drysdall and Kitching’s
(1963; also see Kitching 1963) lower fossiliferous horizon
of the Ntawere Formation.
Identifying Characteristics: In her diagnosis of ‘‘K.’’
latirostris, Crozier (1970) emphasized the broad snout,
absence of any ridges on the snout, vertical orientation of
the tusks, antero-posteriorly short interpterygoid vacuity,
and short dentary symphysis as distinguishing features of

122

the species. There have been three main suggestions for the
generic affinities of BP/1/3636: (1) it is a specimen of
Kannemeyeria, perhaps representing a distinct species (e.g.,
Crozier 1970); (2) it is a specimen of Dolichuranus, perhaps
representing a distinct species (e.g., Keyser 1973c; Keyser
and Cruickshank 1979; King 1988); (3) it is a specimen of
Shansiodon, although its species-level taxonomy in this
scenario has not been discussed (e.g., Cooper 1980; Lucas
1993a, b, 1996, 2001).
A full consideration of the taxonomic and phylogenetic
status of ‘‘K.’’ latirostris is beyond the scope of this study,
but some discussion of the taxonomic problem is warranted.
It is unlikely to be a part of Shansiodon sensu stricto for
several reasons. For example, BP/1/3636 (basal skull length
241 mm) is notably larger than most adult Shansiodon
specimens (e.g., IVPP V2416 has a basal length of 150 mm;
IVPP V2417 has a basal length of 165 mm). It also has
proportionally much smaller tusks that are positioned farther anteriorly relative to the anterior orbital margin, a
longer, wider preorbital region, and anteroposteriorly
shorter temporal openings. Finally, it is worth noting that
the reason BP/1/3636 was referred to Shansiodon was the
hypothesis that Dolichuranus was its junior synonym.
However, recent phylogenetic analyses that included both
Dolichuranus and Shansiodon did not recover a close
relationship between the two taxa (Damiani et al. 2007;
Govender and Yates 2009; Kammerer et al. 2011).
BP/1/3636 also does not fit perfectly within Dolichuranus or Kannemeyeria. Crozier (1970) did not provide a
detailed justification for her referral of BP/1/3636 to Kannemeyeria, only noting that it was of ‘‘Kannemeyeria type.’’
In general appearance, the specimen does resemble Kannemeyeria in features such as its relatively large snout and
narrow, crest-like temporal bar (e.g., Fig. 7.11d, g). However, comparison with the Renaut’s (2000) diagnosis of
Kannemeyeria highlights several differences. For example,
there is no midline ridge on the snout, the occipital plate is
relatively vertical, and the temporal bar is not strongly
angled dorsally, although it is somewhat offset from the
interorbital region of the skull. Furthermore, although
Renaut (2000) did not explicitly state what he thought was
the correct identity for BP/1/3636, he did not include it in
his list of referred specimens for either of the species of
Kannemeyeria that he recognized (K. simocephalus and
K. lophorhinus).
Keyser (1973c) referred the specimen to Dolichuranus
based on overall similarities in shape with the type material
from Namibia, although he noted that the secondary palate
of BP/1/3636 was somewhat shorter. BP/1/3636 does possess similar proportions of the snout and temporal openings
to Dolichuranus specimens such as CGP/1/711 (the holotype of D. primaevus), as well as a similarly long, straight
midventral vomerine plate and small interpterygoid vacuity

K. D. Angielczyk et al.

(Fig. 7.11e). However, it also departs from Damiani et al.’s
(2007) diagnosis of Dolichuranus in characters such as its
more curved alveolar margin in lateral view, its lack of
strongly differentiated nasal bosses and a trough-like furrow
on the anterior surface of the snout, and the absence of an
ectopterygoid.
An additional complication is the possible juvenile status
of BP/1/3636. Crozier (1970) suggested the specimen might
be a sub-adult based on its relatively small size compared to
other Kannemeyeria specimens, and the specimen shows
other potential juvenile features as well. For example, the
orbits are large relative to the overall size of the skull. Orbit
length shows negative allometry in Kannemeyeria (Renaut
2000) and other dicynodonts (Tollman et al. 1980; Ray
2005; Angielczyk 2007; although see Grine et al. 2006), and
the proportions of BP/1/3636 are comparable to similarlysized juvenile specimens of K. simocephalus (e.g., BP/1/
2092; Renaut 2000). The tusks are also relatively small, and
although different dicynodont taxa show different patterns
of allometry for this character (compare Renaut 2000; Ray
2005; Grine et al. 2006), tusk diameter is positively allometric in Kannemeyeria. At the same time, these comparisons assume that the taxon represented by BP/1/3636
underwent a Kannemeyeria-like ontogeny, which would be
logical if BP/1/3636 is eventually shown to be part of
K. lophorhinus but potentially incorrect if it represents a
distinct taxon.
Given these uncertainties, and the fact that BP/1/3636
cannot be easily accommodated within other roughly coeval
taxa such as Tetragonias, Vinceria, Dinodontosaurus, or
Angonisaurus, it is clear that the identity of BP/1/3636
requires further investigation. We follow Fröbisch (2009) in
referring to the specimen as ‘‘Kannemeyeria’’ latirostris
until its affinities can be resolved. However, we add that use
of this specimen for making biogeographic or biostratigraphic inferences is questionable because of its uncertain
identity.
Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: Kannemeyeria, Kannemeyeria latirostris, ‘‘Kannemeyeria’’ latirostris, Dolichuranus latirostris, Dolichuranus, Shansiodon.
Much like BP/1/3638, BP/1/3636 has had a complex taxonomic history. Crozier (1970) named ‘‘K.’’ latirostris.
Keyser (1973c; also see Keyser 1973d) considered the
specimen to be referable to his newly-created genus Dolichuranus, but retained latirostris Crozier, 1970 as a valid
species. Many subsequent authors followed this synonymy
(Keyser 1974; Battail 1978, 1993; Anderson and
Cruickshank 1978; Keyser and Cruickshank 1979; Cooper
1982; King 1988, 1990; Surkov 2000; Renaut 2000;
Rubidge 2005). Given that Ochev and Shishkin (1989) also
report Rechnisaurus from Zambia, it appears that their
record of Kannemeyeria from the Ntawere Formation refers
to BP/1/3636. Cox (1991) stated that only Kannemeyeria

7

Zambian Dicynodont Faunas

was present in the lower fossiliferous horizon of the Ntawere Formation, although he did not discuss the species
latirostris Crozier, 1970 specifically. Other workers, often
arguing from a biostratigraphic perspective, considered
Dolichuranus, including D. latirostris from Zambia, to be a
junior synonym of Shansiodon (Cooper 1980; Lucas 1993a,
b, 1996, 2001; Lucas and Wild 1995). In their redescription
of Dolichuranus, Damiani et al. (2007) stated that they did
not consider the species latirostris Crozier, 1970 to be
referable to this genus, but they did not elaborate on why
they concluded this or their preferred placement for the
species. Based on Damiani et al. (2007), Fröbisch (2008,
2009) referred to the species as ‘‘Kannemeyeria’’ latirostris,
reflecting its uncertain taxonomic status.
Previous Reports: Although Crozier (1970) described
BP/1/3636, the specimen is one of two ‘‘Kannemeyerialike’’ dicynodonts that Drysdall and Kitching (1963) and
Kitching (1963) mentioned collecting at Locality 16 [also
see Brink 1963; Cox 1969; note that Chernin 1974 mistakenly reported these specimens as originating in the
upper fossiliferous horizon at Drysdall and Kitching’s
(1963) Locality 15]. Kitching (1977) included a photograph of BP/1/3636 and referenced it in a discussion of
Karoo taphonomy. Anderson and Cruickshank (1978),
King (1988), Surkov (2000), Rubidge (2005), and Fröbisch
(2009) included ‘‘K.’’ latirostris in their biogeographic
compilations under various names. Battail (1978, 1993)
and Cooper (1982) used the occurrence of ‘‘K.’’ latirostris
(called Dolichuranus in those papers) as a datum for
correlating the lower Ntawere Formation with units in
other basins, as did Ochev and Shishkin (1989), but using
the name Kannemeyeria. Lucas (1993a, b, 1996, 2001;
also see Lucas and Wild 1995), following Cooper (1980),
regarded ‘‘K.’’ latirostris as a synonym of Shansiodon, and
discussed the biostratigraphic implications of this synonymy. In other works (e.g., Lucas 1998b, 2010), however,
he reported only Kannemeyeria from the lower Ntawere
Formation. Keyser (1973c, d, 1974), Keyser and Cruickshank (1979), Cooper (1980), King (1990), Renaut (2000),
and Damiani et al. (2007) discussed ‘‘K.’’ latirostris (often
under the name Dolichuranus) in taxonomic or phylogenetic contexts. Finally, it is important to note that even
though BP/1/3636 was initially referred to Kannemeyeria
by Crozier (1970) and BP/1/3638 (see above) was referred
to Rechnisaurus in the same paper, the rapid reassignment
of these specimens to Dolichuranus and Kannemeyeria
(respectively) means that nearly all subsequent literature
reports of Kannemeyeria from Zambia refer to BP/1/3638,
not BP/1/3636.

Zambiasaurus submersus Cox, 1969

Material: Cox (1969) provided a list of 499 identifiable
elements or fragments of elements, but provides specimen
numbers for 174 specimens in two series: LM/NH 2 to LM/
NH 35 and NHMUK R9001 to NHMUK R9140. The collection includes at least 18 juvenile individuals (based on
the number of distal right humeri) and at least one large
adult.
Localities: All specimens originated at Locality 15 of
Drysdall and Kitching (1963). The type locality of Z. submersus is in Drysdall and Kitching’s (1963; also see
Kitching 1963) upper fossiliferous horizon of the Ntawere
Formation (Cox 1969).
Identifying Characteristics: Cox (1969) provided a
diagnosis for Zambiasaurus submersus. Diagnostic characters he listed include edentulous skull and jaws; short
median suture between nasals; preparietal absent; interparietal that does not extend far forwards on skull roof; sharp
transition between the skull roof and occipital plate; paired
anterior ridges present on the palatal surface of the premaxilla; at least four sacral vertebrae; tall, narrow scapular
blade with a ridge on its lateral surface; coracoid foramen
entirely within the procoracoid.
Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: Zambiosaurus, Zambiasaurus submerses (Surkov 2000; Fröbisch
2009). These appear to be misspellings.
Previous Reports: Although Cox (1969) provided the
first description of Zambiasaurus submersus, Attridge et al.
(1964) made a passing reference to the specimens that
eventually were assigned to this species. King (1988, 1990),
Fröbisch (2009), and Sues and Fraser (2010) included
Zambiasaurus in their faunal lists for the Ntawere Formation. Battail (1978, 1993), Cox (1991), and DeFauw (1993)
included Zambiasaurus in their discussions of Triassic
biostratigraphy, and Surkov (2000) mentioned it in his
biogeographic study. Various authors considered Zambiasaurus in taxonomic or phylogenetic contexts (e.g., Roy
Chowdhury 1970; Keyser and Cruickshank 1979, 1980;
Cooper 1980; Cox and Li 1983; Bandyopadhyay 1988,
1989; Cox 1998; Maisch 2001; Irmis 2005; Kemp 2005,

characters for Sangusaurus are absence of tusks, temporal
bar with a midline groove, presence of a boss posterior to the
pineal foramen, exposure of the interparietal on the dorsal
surface of the temporal bar. Cruickshank (1986) differentiated S. edentatus from S. parringtonii on the basis of the
shape and size of the caniniform process.
Synonyms in Luangwa Basin Literature: Sanguasaurus, Sangausaurus (Keyser and Cruickshank 1979). Both of
these names appear to be misspellings of Sangusaurus.
Previous Reports: Cox (1969) was the first to describe
Sangusaurus from the Luangwa Basin. Anderson and
Cruickshank (1978), King (1988, 1990), and Fröbisch
(2009) included Sangusaurus in their biogeographic compilations. Battail (1978, 1993), Jain and Roy Chowdhury
(1987), Cox (1991), and DeFauw (1993) discussed
S. edentatus in a primarily biostratigraphic context, and
various authors have considered it in a taxonomic or phylogenetic context (e.g., Roy Chowdhury 1970; Keyser and
Cruickshank 1979, 1980; Cooper 1980; Cox and Li 1983;
Cruickshank 1986; Bandyopadhyay 1988, 1989; Cox 1998;
Maisch 2001). Sues and Fraser (2010) included Sangusaurus in their faunal list for the Ntawere Formation.

specimens from Namibia that they assigned to Dolichuranus, cf. Dolichuranus, and cf. Kannemeyeria lophorhinus
that make for relevant comparisons. The humerus of NHCC
LB26 is comparable in size to the juvenile humerus (consisting of specimens NHMUK R9088 and NHMUK R9089;
Fig. 7.12d, e) figured by Cox (1969), but it differs in having
much more fully ossified joint surfaces (particularly on the
distal end) and more strongly flaring ect- and entepicondyles (also compare to NHMUK R9091; Fig. 7.12d). The
adult distal humerus of Zambiasaurus has comparably wellossified joint surfaces, although it is much larger and has
less flared ect- and entepicondyles. The humerus shows
greater similarity to the humeri of cf. Dolichuranus and cf.
K. lophorhinus described by Govender and Yates (2009).
Their specimens of cf. K. lophorhinus (both from CGP
R316) possess similarly flared ect- and entepicondyles, but
the entepicondyles of their specimens of cf. Dolichuranus
(CGP/1/191A and CGP/1/412) do not seem as strongly
flared as in NHCC LB26. Both the specimens of cf. K.
lophorhinus and cf. Dolichuranus figured by Govender and
Yates (2009) also are noteworthy in having a tab-like projection on the posterior surface of the proximal end, near the
insertion of M. subcoracoscapularis. This area is somewhat
damaged in NHCC LB26, but the preserved morphology is
suggestive of a similar tab having been present originally.
In addition to Sangusaurus, Zambiasaurus, K. lophorhinus, and Dolichuranus, several other dicynodont taxa are
documented from coeval beds in southern and eastern
Africa: Kannemeyeria simocephalus, Tetragonias njalilus,
Rechnisaurus cristarhynchus, Angonisaurus cruickshanki,
and Shansiodon sp. (e.g., von Huene 1942; Cruickshank
1967; Cox and Li 1983; King 1988; Hancox and Rubidge
1997, 2001; Hancox 2000; Rubidge 2005, Fröbisch 2009;
Hancox et al. 2013). There are also reports of an additional
taxon from Tanzania that was informally named
‘‘Ruhuhuungulasaurus croucheri’’ in an unpublished thesis
(Larkin 1994; this specimen, NHMUK R12710, was listed
as Shansiodon in Surkov and Benton 2004). Although
humeri are not available for Rechnisaurus or

Kannemeyeriiformes incertae sedis
Figure 7.12m–p
Material: NHCC LB26.
Localities: Locality L12 (NHCC LB26). This locality is
within the outcrops designated as Locality 16 by Drysdall
and Kitching (1963), which is part of their lower fossiliferous horizon of the Ntawere Formation.
Identifying Characteristics: The material in this collection consists of a medium-sized dicynodont humerus
(length approximately 183 mm) (Fig. 7.12m, n), a large
dicynodont fibula (length approximately 279 mm)
(Fig. 7.12o, p), and a rib fragment that likely belonged to an
animal of similar size as that which produced the fibula. Of
the dicynodonts known from the Triassic of Zambia, only
Zambiasaurus includes definite postcranial material
(Cox 1969), although Govender and Yates (2009) described

126

‘‘Ruhuhuungulasaurus,’’ comparisons are possible with the
other taxa. NHCC LB26 differs from the humeri of K. simocephalus (e.g., Govender et al. 2008) in having more
flared distal ect- and entepicondyles. NHCC LB26 may
differ from K. simocephalus in having a tab on the posterior
surface of the proximal end if such a structure was originally present. Cox and Li (1983) did not discuss the
humerus of Angonisaurus that is part of the holotype
(NHMUK R9723), but it is relatively complete with minor
damage to the proximal end, deltopectoral crest, and distal
end. As preserved this specimen appears to have a less
flared distal end than NHCC LB26 and no tab-like projection on the proximal end, and these observations are confirmed by a more fragmentary specimen (NMT RB155) that
likely represents Angonisaurus, which our team collected in
Tanzania in 2007. The humeri are somewhat better preserved in the holotype of Tetragonias (GPIT 292) than the
referred specimen (CAMZM T753) described by Cruickshank (1967). GPIT 292 possesses a comparably flared
distal end and a well-developed tab-like projection on the
posterior surface of the proximal end. The humeral head is
also prominent and well-ossified in GPIT 292, and a similar
situation seems to be the case in NHCC LB26, although this
area is also somewhat damaged. Unfortunately, the deltopectoral crest of NHCC LB26 is not preserved, so we
cannot determine whether it possessed the hook-like anterodistal corner present in Tetragonias (Cruickshank 1967).
A humerus for the South African Shansiodon specimen is
not available for comparison. However, comparison to
Chinese material of Shansiodon (e.g., IVPP V.2415; see
Yeh 1959) shows that NHCC LB26 may show some similarities (e.g., well-defined humeral head, tab-like projection
on the posterior surface of proximal end). At the same time,
NHCC LB26 is larger and also appears to have a more
flared distal end.
The fibula of Zambiasaurus is known only from juvenile
material (NHMUK R9128, R9129) (e.g., Fig. 7.12j). Those
elements show a similar degree of curvature to NHCC
LB26, but the joint surfaces are nearly entirely unossified,
precluding detailed comparisons. The fibula of cf.
K. lophorhinus (CGP R316) figured by Govender and Yates
(2009) has a much straighter shaft than that of NHCC LB26.
Although not prepared, NHCC LB26 appears to lack the
groove on the posterior surface seen in CGP R316. The
proximal and distal ends of CGP R316 also seem less
expanded than those of NHCC LB26, although Govender
and Yates’ (2009) photographs make it seem like these
areas may be somewhat weathered. NHCC LB26 shows
similarity to the fibula of Dolichuranus (BP/1/4578)
described by Govender and Yates (2009), particularly in the
curvature of the shaft. However, the curvature of the shaft is
greater in NHCC LB26 (and this does not appear to be a
taphonomic artifact given that the specimen is well

K. D. Angielczyk et al.

preserved and does not show signs of crushing or plastic
deformation) and there is no evidence of a groove on the
posterior surface of the shaft comparable to that in BP/1/
4578.
Fibulae also are available for comparison for Tetragonias, K. simocephalus, and ‘‘Ruhuhuungulasaurus.’’ The
fibula of the holotype of Tetragonias (GPIT 292) is strongly
curved, but the profile of this curvature is different than in
NHCC LB26. In the latter specimen the shaft smoothly
curves, whereas in GPIT K292 the offset between the
proximal and distal ends of the fibula is more of a distinct
kink. The fibula of the referred specimen (CAMZM T754)
described by Cruickshank (1967) is more smoothly curved,
giving it a profile more comparable to that of NHCC LB26.
The proximal and distal ends of NHCC LB26 are more
expanded and more strongly ossified than those of either
Tetragonias specimen, though, and NHCC LB26 is considerably larger. The fibula of K. simocephalus (e.g., Govender
et al. 2008) also is smoothly curved, but again is typically
somewhat smaller than NHCC LB26. The latter specimen
also differs from K. simocephalus in having a well developed
ridge-like edge that forms the posterior margin of the distal
articular surface, although some of this difference may stem
from the fact that NHCC LB26 represents an animal that is
larger than most known Kannemeyeria specimens. The
longitudinal groove on the posterior surface of the shaft of
the fibula in K. simocephalus described by Govender et al.
(2008) appears to be absent in NHCC LB26. Finally, the
fibula of ‘‘Ruhuhuungulasaurus’’ (NHMUK R12710) shows
a similar degree of curvature as NHCC LB26, and its
proximal and distal ends are relatively expanded. The
articular surfaces are well-defined, but the distal surface is
somewhat damaged, making it uncertain whether the posterior edge of distal surface had the form of a distinct ridge.
NHCC LB26 also represents a considerably larger animal.
Only two major clades of dicynodonts are known to
occur in the Middle Triassic, the emydopoids (represented
only by Kombuisia frerensis in the Karoo Basin), and the
much more diverse Kannemeyeriiformes. The elements
included in NHCC LB26 are much larger than any known
emydopoid specimens (Permian or Triassic), so we are
confident in their referral to Kannemeyeriiformes. However,
the limited amount of material available, and the fact that
the specimens show a mixture of similarities to and differences from coeval dicynodonts known from southern and
eastern Africa, prevent us from unequivocally assigning
them to a specific dicynodont taxon. Their similarities to
likely Kannemeyeria lophorhinus specimens from Namibia
and their occurrence in outcrops assigned to Locality 16 by
Drysdall and Kitching (1963) make K. lophorhinus a
potential identification that deserves more scrutiny as
additional postcranial material referrable to that species
becomes available. Likewise, as more comparative material

7

Zambian Dicynodont Faunas

of Z. submersus and S. edentatus become available, and the
taxonomic uncertainty regarding BP/1/3636 (‘‘K.’’ latirostris) is resolved, it will be important to determine whether
NHCC LB26 falls within the ranges of variation for any of
these taxa. Finally, the fact that the humerus of NHCC
LB26 shows similarities to shansiodontids such as Tetragonias and Shansiodon is intriguing because this specimen
could represent the first occurrence of this clade in Zambia.
However, additional specimens, particularly cranial material, will be necessary to confirm this possibility.
Triassic Dicynodonts Whose Presence in Zambia Cannot
be Confirmed
Shansiodon Yeh, 1959
Previous Reports: Cooper (1980) and Lucas (1993a, b,
1996, 2001) suggested that Shansiodon was present in the
Ntawere Formation. This occurrence was based on a twostep reasoning process that accepted Keyser’s (1973c)
referral of BP/1/3636 to Dolichuranus and then posited that
Dolichuranus was a junior synonym of Shansiodon. Neither
Cooper (1980) nor Lucas (1993a, b, 1996, 2001) specified
whether the putative Zambian occurrence of Shansiodon
represented the type species Shansiodon wangi Yeh, 1959
or a different species. As noted above, both steps in this
reasoning are questionable. BP/1/3636 diverges from the
diagnosis of Dolichuranus and is not clearly referable to the
genus (Damiani et al. 2007). Even if BP/1/3636 is eventually shown to be part of Dolichuranus, the synonymy
between it and Shansiodon is unlikely because recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that Shansiodon and Dolichuranus are not closely related (Damiani et al. 2007; Govender
and Yates 2009; Kammerer et al. 2011). We are unaware of
any Zambian specimens that can be referred unequivocally
to Shansiodon. Therefore, we do not consider it part of the
Zambian Triassic dicynodont fauna.
Angonisaurus cruickshanki Cox and Li, 1983
Previous Reports: Sues and Fraser (2010) included
Angonisaurus in their list of dicynodont taxa known from
the Ntawere Formation in the Luangwa Basin, and cited
Cox (1969, 1991) as sources. However, Angonisaurus was
not reported from Zambia in either of these papers, and we
are unaware of any unpublished specimens that would
support this record. Therefore, we do not consider Angonisaurus to be part of the Zambian Triassic dicynodont fauna.

127

subsequent authors further highlighted the distinctions
between BP/1/3638 (and the specimen of K. lophorhinus
from Namibia) and Rechnisaurus (Bandyopadhyay 1985,
1989; King 1988; Renaut 2000; Renaut et al. 2003), and if
these observations are accepted, then Rechnisaurus is not
present in the Ntawere Formation of Zambia. Lucas argued
repeatedly that Rechnisaurus and K. lophorhinus (usually
K. cristarhynchus in his papers) are synonyms (1993b,
1996, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2010; also see Lucas and Wild,
1995). If this synonymy is correct, it still would not imply
the presence of Rechnisaurus in Zambia, since that taxon
would be a junior synonym of Kannemeyeria (i.e., it would
imply the presence of Kannemeyeria in India instead).
Given these observations, and the fact that there are currently no other specimens from the Ntawere Formation that
could represent Rechnisaurus (if it is a valid taxon), we
conclude that Rechnisaurus is not part of the Zambian
Triassic dicynodont fauna.
Dolichuranus Keyser, 1973c
Previous Reports: Keyser (1973c) was the first author to
suggest that Dolichuranus occurred in the Ntawere Formation when he referred BP/1/3636, the holotype of Kannemeyeria latirostris Crozier, 1970, to the genus. Many
subsequent authors followed this synonymy (Keyser 1974;
Anderson and Cruickshank 1978; Battail 1978, 1993; Keyser
and Cruickshank 1979; Cooper 1982; King 1988, 1990;
Surkov 2000; Renaut 2000; Rubidge 2005). Most only
referred to the genus Dolichuranus in Zambia, but Keyser
and Cruickshank (1979) and King (1988) listed Dolichuranus latirostris as a valid species. As noted above however,
BP/1/3636 differs from Damiani et al.’s (2007) diagnosis of
Dolichuranus, making its assignment to the genus questionable. Likewise, although NHCC LB26 shows some
similarities to Dolichuranus postcrania collected in Namibia,
we do not consider it complete enough to provide a definitive
identification. Until the identity of BP/1/3636 is resolved
and/or new specimens are discovered that can be unequivocally identified as Dolichuranus, we do not consider it to be
a part of the Zambian Triassic dicynodont fauna.

Discussion

How Many Faunal Assemblages are Preserved
in the Fossiliferous Beds of the Upper
Rechnisaurus cristarhynchus Roy Chowdhury, 1970
Previous Reports: Crozier (1970) initially referred BP/ Madumabisa Mudstone?

1/3638 to Rechnisaurus cristarhynchus. Keyser (1973c; also
see Battail 1978, 1993 and Ochev and Shishkin 1989) followed this taxonomy, but by 1974 was expressing doubts
that later culminated in the transfer of the specimen to
Kannemeyeria (Keyser and Cruickshank 1979). Several

The idea that the Upper Madumabisa Mudstone preserves
multiple Permian assemblages can be traced back to the
earliest works on the paleontology of the Luangwa Basin.
Dixey (1937) reported fossils in five horizons that are now

128

considered part of the Madumabisa Mudstone (Drysdall and
Kitching 1963) in the northern part of the basin. Based on
comparisons of the fossils Dixey collected with specimens
in South Africa, Boonstra (1938) concluded that some of
these horizons might be coeval, but that assemblages corresponding to the Endothiodon and Cistecephalus zones of
the South African Karoo (equivalent to the Tropidostoma,
Cistecephalus, and Dicynodon assemblage zones of
Rubidge et al. 1995) were present. Drysdall and Kitching
(1962, 1963) and Kitching (1963) considered the problem in
more detail, recognized that sets of Dixey’s horizons were
parts of single layers offset by faulting, and added several
additional fossil localities to Dixey’s list. Based on perceived faunal differences, they recognized lower, middle,
and upper fossiliferous horizons in their Upper Madumabisa
Mudstone. They considered the lower horizon to be
equivalent to rocks of the Endothiodon zone of South Africa
(now the Tropidostoma Assemblage Zone), and the middle
and upper horizons to be equivalent to rocks of the Cistecephalus zone (equivalent to the current Cistecephalus and/
or Dicynodon assemblage zones). The discovery of Permian
fossils in the central Luangwa Basin (Kemp 1975) generally
has been regarded as adding a fourth fossiliferous horizon
that is equivalent to rocks of the Dicynodon Assemblage
Zone of South Africa, a conclusion reinforced by the suggested co-occurrence of Dicynodon and Lystrosaurus in one
of these localities (King and Jenkins 1997). Most recent
biostratigraphic works included two assemblages in the
Upper Madumabisa Mudstone equivalent to those of the
Cistecephalus and Dicynodon assemblage zones of South
Africa (e.g., Lucas 1998a, 2002, 2005, 2006; Rubidge
2005), although Fröbisch (2009) included four assemblages
(consisting of Drysdall and Kitching’s three horizons from
the north of the basin and Kemp’s horizon from the central
basin) in his biogeographic study.
Our taxonomic revision of the dicynodonts of the Upper
Madumabisa Mudstone provides an opportunity to reassess
whether there is strong evidence of multiple assemblages in
the formation or if the various localities throughout the
basin are better regarded as sampling a single assemblage.
To test the hypotheses of single versus multiple assemblages, we compiled faunal lists for each of Drysdall and
Kitching’s (1963) three fossiliferous horizons and Kemp’s
(1975) horizon based on voucher specimens identified from
historical localities and our new localities in their immediate proximity. Because none of our new fossil localities
fall within Drysdall and Kitching’s (1963) lower and middle
horizons, and we identified few or no voucher specimens
from these horizons in museum collections, we supplemented the faunal lists with our reidentifications of Drysdall
and Kitching’s (1963) field identifications.
A clear pattern emerges from these results (Table 7.3).
Kemp’s (1975) central Luangwa Basin localities have the

K. D. Angielczyk et al.

greatest taxonomic richness, with 14 species represented.
Drysdall and Kitching’s (1963) upper horizon is a close
second (10 species), followed by the lower horizon (six
species) and the middle horizon (at least two species). More
importantly, the assemblages of all three of Drysdall and
Kitching’s (1963) horizons consist of subsamples of the
assemblage present in Kemp’s (1975) localities; no taxa are
confined only to one or more of the lower horizons.
Importantly, the subsamples all include taxa that have been
hypothesized to have biostratigraphic utility, such as
Endothiodon, Odontocyclops, Dicynodon huenei, and the
new cistecephalid, not just stratigraphically long-ranging
taxa such as Pristerodon or Diictodon. Based on these
observations, we consider it most conservative to posit only
a single assemblage in the Upper Madumabisa Mudstone,
similar to the situation recognized for the Usili Formation of
Tanzania (Sidor et al. 2010). We hypothesize that the
assemblage from the central Luangwa Basin localities is
more completely sampled primarily because of taphonomic
issues. In particular, specimens from these localities tend to
be more complete and easier to prepare than those from the
northern localities, which are often encased in highly
resistant hematite nodules. This nodular preservation style
makes field identifications of specimens and collecting
decisions difficult, in addition to slowing preparation.
Nevertheless, Drysdall and Kitching’s (1963) upper horizon, particularly their Locality 4, shows that it is possible to
gain a relatively complete picture of the assemblage even in
areas characterized by preservation in hematite nodules.

Permian Biostratigraphy and Biogeography
As noted above, most previous workers who considered the
biostratigraphy of the Upper Madumabisa Mudstone correlated it with rocks belonging to one or more of the
biozones of the South African Karoo Basin (e.g., Boonstra
1938; Drysdall and Kitching 1963; Kemp 1975; King and
Jenkins 1997; Lucas 1998a, 2002, 2005, 2006; Angielczyk
2002; Rubidge 2005; Fröbisch 2009). Stratigraphic ranges
for taxa that occur in South Africa and Zambia, as well as
Dicynodon lacerticeps (which is closely related to D. huenei; Kammerer et al. 2011) and Cistecephalus (the likely
closest South African relative of the Zambian tusked
cistecephalid) are shown in Fig. 7.13. Given the long ranges
of several of the taxa, it is easy to see why previous authors
suggested the presence of multiple faunal assemblages
corresponding to two to three South African assemblage
zones.
The assumption of a single faunal assemblage in the
Upper Madumabisa Mudstone greatly simplifies the problem. The taxa found in both the Karoo Basin and the

Luangwa Basin all only overlap stratigraphically in the
Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone of Rubidge et al. (1995;
roughly equivalent to Faunachron I of Lucas 2002 and the
Steilkransian of Lucas 2005, 2006) (Fig. 7.13). Even if
some diachroneity in stratigraphic ranges is allowed
between the two basins, it still seems likely that the Upper
Madumabisa Mudstone primarily represents Cistecephalus
Assemblage Zone time, with only limited overlap with the
Tropidostoma and/or Dicynodon assemblage zones. This
conclusion is significant because if true, it implies that the
Upper Madumabisa Mudstone cannot provide direct insight
into faunal turnover at the Permo-Triassic boundary.
Our faunal revision also demonstrates that Zambia is an
important biostratigraphic link between the South African
Karoo Basin and the Ruhuhu Basin of Tanzania. A number of
authors noted that the Ruhuhu Basin includes a mixture of
widespread and endemic taxa, as well as taxa that do not
overlap stratigraphically in the Karoo Basin, complicating
correlations between the two areas (e.g., Gay and

Cruickshank 1999; Maisch 2002c; Abdala and Allinson
2005; Angielczyk 2007; Weide et al. 2009; Sidor et al. 2010).
However, the presence of Dicynodon huenei in both Tanzania and Zambia allows a direct correlation between the Usili
Formation and the Upper Madumabisa Mudstone. A second
direct correlation between the two formations may be possible with Katumbia parringtoni if more definitive specimens
than the jaw we collected in 2009 come to light. In turn, the
well-supported correlation between the Upper Madumabisa
Mudstone and the rocks of the Cistecephalus Assemblage
Zone in the Karoo Basin implies that the Usili Formation also
may best be regarded as primarily representing Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone time.
Finally, our results also have implications for biogeographic patterns in the Late Permian of southern and eastern
Africa. As noted above, there has been much discussion of
endemism in the Usili Formation assemblage (e.g., Gay and
Cruickshank 1999; Maisch 2002c; Abdala and Allinson
2005; Angielczyk 2007; Weide et al. 2009; Sidor et al.

Fig. 7.13 Biostratigraphic comparison of the South African Beaufort
Group (Karoo Basin) and the Zambian Upper Madumabisa Mudstone
(Luangwa Basin). Stratigraphic ranges of nine dicynodont genera in
both basins are plotted; Cistecephalus and Dicynodon lacerticeps
occur only in the Karoo Basin but are closely related to the tusked
Zambian cistecephalid and Dicynodon huenei, respectively. Ranges for
the Karoo Basin and are based primarily on Rubidge et al. (1995), with
modifications from Angielczyk (2002), Angielczyk et al. (2005, 2009),
Botha and Smith (2006), Botha and Angielczyk (2007), and BothaBrink et al. (2013). The range for Compsodon is uncertain because it is
known from only a single specimen in the Karoo Basin. This specimen
was discovered at a locality that also yielded Rhachiocephalus and
Oudenodon (Kitching, 1977), and the stratigraphic range shown for
Compsodon represents the overlap of the ranges of these two taxa.
The stratigraphic range of Dicynodon lacerticeps is uncertain because
the taxonomic revision of Kammerer et al. (2011) has greatly modified
the content of that species compared to other recent usages The upper
limit of its range is based on Botha-Brink et al.’s (2013) report of D.
lacerticeps specimen BP/1/4026 close to the Permo-Triassic boundary.

the South African Karoo Basin. Despite its intermediate
geographic location, the Upper Madumabisa Mudstone
assemblage received little attention on its own or in relation
to the Tanzanian assemblage. Table 7.4 shows dicynodont
species present in the Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone of
South Africa, the Upper Madumabisa Mudstone, and the
Usili Formation. Our focus on the species level introduces
some uncertainty because species-level identifications for
some of the taxa occurring in Zambia are difficult (e.g.,
Endothiodon, Emydops, Dicynodontoides). Nevertheless,

K. D. Angielczyk et al.

we think it is important to use as detailed information as
possible because previous research on this question showed
that the results can be influenced by choice of taxonomic
level (Abdala and Allinson 2005).
Three important points emerge from this comparison.
First, in terms of their dicynodont assemblages, the Karoo,
Luangwa, and Ruhuhu basins form something of a faunal
gradient: eight to nine of the 14 (57–64 %) species present
in Zambia also are found in the Karoo Basin, whereas only
five of the 14 (36 %) species present in Tanzania also occur
in South Africa. However, this pattern is not perfect because
each basin shares different taxa with the others. Thus, the
Luangwa Basin and the Karoo basin show roughly the same
degree of similarity to the Ruhuhu Basin (only four to six,
or 29–43 %, of the species in the Luangwa Basin also are
found in the Ruhuhu Basin; five of 20 or 25 % of the species in the Karoo Basin are present in the Luangwa Basin).
This fact is surprising given the closer proximity of the
Ruhuhu and Luangwa basins now and during the Permian.
Second, both the Luangwa Basin and the Ruhuhu Basin
include endemic dicynodont species, but Tanzania is characterized by slightly more endemism (three of 14, or 21 %,
endemic in Zambia; five to seven of 14, or 36–50 %,
endemic in Tanzania). Interestingly, the Karoo Basin itself
shows a previously unappreciated degree of endemism
during Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone times (eight to 11
species, or 40–55 %), so the Luangwa Basin may be unusual in having fewer endemic species than its neighbors.
Third, there does not seem to be an obvious relationship
between ecology and dispersal abilities among the dicynodonts in the three basins. For example, it might be
expected that larger species were more likely to be widespread given their greater resource needs. However, more
than half of the species that are definitely restricted to a
single basin (Aulacephalodon baini, Dicynodon lacerticeps,
Syops vanhoepeni, Dinanomodon gilli, Oudenodon grandis,
Pachytegos stockleyi, Rhachiocephalus behemoth) also are
of large body size (maximum skull lengths in excess of
300 mm; estimated for Pachytegos based on comparisons
with Endothiodon), whereas several small-bodied species
are found in two or more basins (e.g., Compsodon helmoedi,
Diictodon feliceps, Pristerodon mackayi, either Emydops
arctatus or Emydops oweni). Ecological specialization also
seems to have an inconsistent effect. Cistecephaloides
boonstrai, Kawingasaurus fossilis, and the Zambian tusked
cistecephalid each are restricted to a single basin, as might
be expected for animals characterized by a specialized
fossorial lifestyle (Cox 1972; Cluver 1974a), but Cistecephalus microrhinus shares a comparable lifestyle (Cluver
1978) and also is found in India (Kutty 1972; Ray 1997,
1999, 2000, 2001; Ray and Bandyopadhyay 2003). Taken
together, these observations emphasize Angielczyk’s (2007)
and Angielczyk and Sullivan’s (2008) suggestions that the

factors controlling Permian dicynodont distributions were
complex, and a combination of quantitative approaches
such as those of Fröbisch (2009) and techniques that
incorporate phylogeny (see Angielczyk and Kurkin 2003 for
a simple example) will be important in resolving their
biogeographic history.

Triassic Biostratigraphy and Biogeography
Although our review of the Zambian Triassic dicynodonts
does not result in changes in the number or identities of the
currently-recognized species, it does underscore the fact
that a good deal of uncertainty surrounds these taxa, making
their use in biogeographic and biostratigraphic studies difficult. The dicynodonts of the lower Ntawere Formation
show the greatest similarity to the Triassic dicynodonts of
Namibia. Indeed, the presence of Kannemeyeria lophorhinus in the lower Ntawere Formation provides a direct correlation between these rocks and those of the upper
Omingonde Formation of Namibia (e.g., Keyser 1973c;
Keyser and Cruickshank 1979; Cooper 1982; Cox 1991;
Lucas 1998a, b; Rubidge 2005). However, considering that
this species is known from only two specimens (i.e., one
specimen each from Zambia and Namibia; Renaut 2000;
Renaut et al. 2003), its stratigraphic ranges in Namibia and
Zambia are not well-constrained and correlations based on
it will necessarily be imprecise until additional material can
be recovered. If ‘‘Kannemeyeria’’ latirostris eventually
proves to pertain to Dolichuranus, it would provide a second direct link between the lower Ntawere and the upper
Omingonde formations (e.g., Keyser 1973c; Keyser and
Cruickshank 1979; Cooper 1982; Battail 1993; Abdala et al.
2005; Rubidge 2005), and potentially to the Cynognathus C
subzone of South Africa if a temporal bar tentatively
referred to Dolichuranus by Abdala et al. (2005) truly
represents this taxon. Alternatively, if it is not Dolichuranus, ‘‘K.’’ latirostris could represent an endemic species or
provide biogeographic and/or biostratigraphic links with
other basins both in Africa and elsewhere. This issue will
not be resolved until the morphology, taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships of the specimen are reexamined in
detail. The problem of ‘‘K.’’ latirostris also highlights the
fact that alphataxonomic work on Triassic dicynodonts has
lagged behind corresponding Permian work, and that this
discrepancy has implications extending beyond simple
measures of dicynodont diversity.
The dicynodonts of the upper Ntawere Formation are
known from much more fragmentary material than those
of the lower Ntawere, even though they are represented by
a much greater number of individual specimens. Sangusaurus has received more biostratigraphic attention than

K. D. Angielczyk et al.

Zambiasaurus because it also occurs in the Lifua Member
of the Manda beds of Tanzania, providing a direct link
between the Luangwa and Ruhuhu basins (Cruickshank
1986; Jain and Roy Chowdhury 1987; Cox 1991; Battail
1993; DeFauw 1993). However, the Zambian specimen is
very fragmentary, and nearly all of the descriptive and
phylogenetic work carried out on Sangusaurus focuses on
Tanzanian material (Cruickshank 1986; Bandyopadhyay
1989; Maisch 2001; Surkov and Benton 2004; Kammerer
et al. 2011). The question of whether S. edentatus and
S. parringtonii are distinct species will be particularly
important to address with future material from Zambia.
Zambiasaurus is of little biostratigraphic utility because it
is endemic to the Luangwa Basin. It may be of biogeographic significance if it is closely related to Stahleckeria
(Cox 1969; Cox and Li 1983; Bandyopadhyay 1988; King
1988; Maisch 2001) since this would suggest an African
origin for the lineage, but the only phylogenetic analysis to
include Zambiasaurus did not recover such a relationship
(Surkov et al. 2005). Again, both a detailed reassessment
of the currently available Zambiasaurus specimens and the
discovery of more complete specimens, particularly cranial
material, are needed to improve our understanding of this
taxon.

Conclusions
(1) The Upper Permian Upper Madumabisa Mudstone in
the Luangwa Basin of Zambia preserves a single
assemblage of dicynodonts consisting of 14 taxa:
Pristerodon mackayi, Endothiodon sp., Diictodon feliceps, Compsodon helmoedi, Emydops sp., Dicynodontoides cf. D. nowacki, a new tusked cistecephalid
represented by five specimens (BP/1/3337, BP/1/3591,
BP/1/3603, NHCC LB18, NHCC LB19), cf. Katumbia
parringtoni, Kitchinganomodon crassus, Oudenodon
bainii, Odontocyclops whaitsi, Dicynodon huenei,
Syops vanhoepeni, and a new lystrosaurid taxon represented by one specimen (TSK 2). Importantly, we find
no evidence of Lystrosaurus sensu stricto in the Upper
Madumabisa Mudstone. Previous reports of a number
of additional taxa are duplications of one of the above
taxa, mistakes, or based on non-diagnostic material.
(2) The Middle Triassic Ntawere Formation preserves two
dicynodont assemblages. The lower Ntawere assemblage consists of Kannemeyeria lophorhinus and
‘‘Kannemeyeria’’ latirostris. The upper Ntawere
assemblage includes Zambiasaurus submersus and
Sangusaurus edentatus. Previous reports of additional
dicynodont taxa primarily reflect the complex taxonomic histories of K. lophorhinus and ‘‘K.’’ latirostris.

Zambian Dicynodont Faunas

(3) The Upper Madumabisa Mudstone dicynodont assemblage is best correlated with the Cistecephalus
Assemblage Zone of the Karoo Basin of South Africa.
In turn, the presence of Dicynodon huenei in the
Luangwa and Ruhuhu basins, as well as the probable
occurrence of Katumbia parringtoni in both basins,
suggests that the dicynodont assemblage of the Tanzanian Usili Formation also can be correlated with the
Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone.
(4) The Upper Madumabisa Mudstone dicynodont assemblage shows greater similarity to the dicynodont fauna
of the South African Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone
than to the assemblage preserved in the Tanzanian Usili
Formation, despite the closer proximity of the Ruhuhu
and Luangwa Basins. Both the Usili Formation and the
Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone include more endemic
species than the Madumabisa Mudstone, but the distribution of species in these and other basins suggests
that the factors controlling the geographic ranges of
Permian dicynodonts were complex.
(5) The lower Ntawere Formation dicynodont assemblage
resembles the upper Omingonde Formation of Namibia
in the presence of Kannemeyeria lophorhinus. However,
the stratigraphic range of this species is poorly constrained because it is represented by a single specimen in
each place. If ‘‘Kannemeyeria’’ latirostris is part of
Dolichuranus, it would provide an additional tie between
these formations, but resolution of this issue must await a
reconsideration of the taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships of ‘‘Kannemeyeria’’ latirostris.
(6) Sangusaurus provides a link between the upper Ntawere Formation and the Lifua Member of the Manda
beds, and an important question to address in the future
is whether S. edentatus and S. parringtonii are distinct
species. Zambiasaurus submersus is endemic to the
Luangwa Basin and therefore is of little biostratigraphic
utility. It may have biogeographic significance if it is a
close relative of Stahleckeria, but additional work is
needed to test this hypothesis.

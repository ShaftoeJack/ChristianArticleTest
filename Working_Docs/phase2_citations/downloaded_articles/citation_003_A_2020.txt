The decline in species richness from the equator to the poles is referred to as the
latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG). Higher equatorial diversity has been
recognized for over 200 years, but the consistency of this pattern in deep time
remains uncertain. Examination of spatial biodiversity patterns in the past
across different global climate regimes and continental configurations can
reveal how LDGs have varied over Earth history and potentially differentiate
between suggested causal mechanisms. The Late Permian–Middle Triassic represents an ideal time interval for study, because it is characterized by large-scale
volcanic episodes, extreme greenhouse temperatures and the most severe mass
extinction event in Earth history. We examined terrestrial and marine tetrapod
spatial biodiversity patterns using a database of global tetrapod occurrences.
Terrestrial tetrapods exhibit a bimodal richness distribution throughout the
Late Permian–Middle Triassic, with peaks in the northern low latitudes and
southern mid-latitudes around 20–40° N and 60° S, respectively. Marine reptile
fossils are known almost exclusively from the Northern Hemisphere in the
Early and Middle Triassic, with highest diversity around 20° N. Reconstructed
terrestrial LDGs contrast strongly with the generally unimodal gradients of
today, potentially reflecting high global temperatures and prevailing Pangaean
super-monsoonal climate system during the Permo-Triassic.

The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) is one of the largest scale and longest
known patterns in ecology (e.g. [1–7]). Modern biodiversity (i.e. richness) gradients are broadly defined as unimodal, with high biodiversity near the
equator and low biodiversity at the poles [4,6]. The specifics of these gradients
differ among taxonomic and ecological groups [2–4,6], and research over the
last decade has revealed greater variation in modern LDGs than previously
recognized. For example, benthic marine species richness appears to peak at
10–20° N, whereas pelagic species richness appears bimodal, with peaks at
10–40° on either side of the equator [8–11].
Study of the fossil record suggests the shape of LDGs has also changed
through time [5,12]. Dinosaur diversity may have been greatest at temperate
latitudes throughout the Mesozoic [13], North American mammal diversity
may have been distributed evenly across latitudes for much of the Cenozoic
[14,15] and peaks in marine animal diversity may have drifted from the
Southern to Northern Hemisphere over the course of the Phanerozoic [16,17].
Numerous drivers of LDGs have been proposed (e.g. [2,3,18–22]). Interaction between key processes, the complexity of feedback cycles, and the
covariance of many environmental variables with latitude complicate efforts
to isolate causal mechanisms [2–4,6,23]. Climate and landmass distribution,
however, have been put forward consistently as potential explanatory variables.
Climate, particularly temperature and water availability, has long been considered a key control on spatial patterns of terrestrial biodiversity

2. Methods
We conducted an in-depth literature review to maximize the completeness and robustness of our Late Permian to Late Triassic
dataset for tetrapods. All tetrapod fossils from the Wuchiapingian
(early Late Permian) through Carnian (early Late Triassic) were
downloaded from the Paleobiology Database (PBDB). Genus
names from this download were used to conduct a systematic literature search in Google Scholar, and any new taxa and
occurrences were added to the Paleobiology Database. Once completed, the same criteria were used to download the enlarged
dataset (in October 2018) [59]. We reviewed each ‘collection’,
representing fossils from a particular locality and considered to
be of a similar age, to increase temporal resolution. A literature
search for formation names was conducted, with publications
that listed the ages of specific beds or members further refining
the geological date of collections, where possible [59]. We streamlined the mode of preservation and taxon habitat categories,
reduced to either ‘body’ or ‘trace’, and ‘marine’ or ‘terrestrial’,
respectively. Finally, the modern latitude and longitude of fossil
localities were rotated to their palaeo-position at the time of deposition by filtering occurrences on a stage-by-stage basis then using
the PALEOMAP Global Plate Model [60], implemented in GPlates (version 2.1.0) [61]. The final dataset constituted 3563
unique tetrapod occurrences assigned to stage level, with our
search efforts contributing 490 of these occurrences (13.8%).
All subsequent data manipulation and plotting was carried
out in R [62] using the ‘tidyverse’ suite of packages [63]. The
final dataset was filtered to include only records representing
unique species, comprising those identified to species level and
those identified to coarser taxonomic levels but representing a
clade not already within their spatio-temporal bin. Since abundance data in the Paleobiology Database are relatively
incomplete and inconsistently applied, the presence of a species
within any given collection was treated as a single occurrence.

examine sea surface temperature (SST) change across the Late
Permian and Early Triassic, recovering remarkably high SSTs
throughout the interval but particularly during the Smithian–
Spathian Thermal Maximum (approx. 248 Ma), when equatorial SSTs may have approached 40° C. Their qualitative analysis
of tetrapod occurrences revealed an equatorial ‘tetrapod gap’ in
the Early Triassic, hypothesized to have occurred due to the
extreme warm temperatures that may have approached or
exceeded the thermal tolerances of both terrestrial and marine
vertebrates (around 42° C [57]). Bernardi et al. [52] also examined the distribution of individual tetrapod skeletal and
footprint occurrences through the extinction and recovery interval, finding evidence for a poleward shift in tetrapod
abundance in the Northern Hemisphere, but only in the
Induan (earliest Triassic). This biogeographic pattern is congruent with a study of tetrapods immediately prior to the PTME,
which found higher tetrapod diversity at temperate than
equatorial latitudes during the Middle–Late Permian [58].
Here, we explore further the terrestrial and marine
Permo-Triassic fossil tetrapod record by comparing specieslevel tetrapod biodiversity across latitudinal bins. We apply
coverage-based interpolation and squares extrapolation to
reconstruct LDGs from the Late Permian (before the PTME),
Early Triassic (in the aftermath of the PTME) and Middle
Triassic (during recovery). These LDGs are then assessed in
light of the hypothesis that higher diversity will be found
in the cooler refugia of the mid to high latitudes during
extreme greenhouse conditions, such as during the Late
Permian to Middle Triassic.

[5,12,14,15,17,24–26] because the distributions of species are
limited by climatic tolerance [22,24,27–30].
LDG studies in deep time have suggested palaeoclimate
regime is a major control on the shape and slope of LDGs. Icehouse periods have been associated with a sharp, unimodal
equatorial richness peak and greenhouse periods with a
bimodal distribution, characterized by shallow peaks at midlatitudes of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres
[5,17,31]. This contrast has been attributed to the strength of
the pole-to-equator temperature gradient between the two climate regimes [5,13,17], but may also reflect spatio-temporal
variations in precipitation [14,22,25]. The distribution of continental landmasses may also structure global patterns of
biodiversity by controlling the spatial distribution of relevant
habitats, particularly shallow continental shelf area in marine
ecosystems [32–35]. Although studies of modern LDGs continue to provide insight into potential generative mechanisms
(e.g. [36–39]), examination of LDGs during intervals when climate and landmass distribution were considerably different to
today may provide new perspectives on global biodiversity
patterns and their associated processes [5,13,31].
The Late Permian to Middle Triassic (approx. 260–
239 Ma) represents a period in Earth history that contrasts
considerably with the present day. Large-scale volcanism
associated with the Siberian Traps drove extreme climate
change, which was exacerbated by amalgamation of most
landmasses into the supercontinent Pangaea [40–42]. This
drove environmental perturbations that resulted in the most
catastrophic mass extinction event of all time at the end of
the Permian, around 252 Ma [43]. A prolonged interval of
extremely high temperatures, which peaked in the Olenekian
(late Early Triassic) [44], along with ocean anoxia and acidification have been identified as key extinction mechanisms
[43,45], with persistence of these conditions extending well
into the Middle Triassic, delaying full structural recovery of
marine ecosystems for as long as 50 million years [46]. On
land, high temperatures and seasonal precipitation in central
Pangaea resulted in drought [40,47–49], while purported
ozone depletion, brought about by halogen gas release
from the Siberian Traps, resulted in high UV-B levels that
caused plant sterilization and extinction (e.g. [50,51]). Early
Triassic temperatures at low latitudes are considered to
have been beyond the tolerable long-term threshold for
both plants and animals, driving extinction and poleward
migration [44,52]. The climate of the Middle Triassic has
received less attention, but is thought to have been characterized by continued aridity in lower latitudes, with cyclical
temperature fluctuations overprinting a general trend of
steady cooling after the final eruptions of the Siberian Traps
in the Olenekian [41,42].
Tetrapods were profoundly affected by the Permo-Triassic
mass extinction (PTME). In the immediate aftermath, Early
Triassic tetrapod communities were composed almost
entirely of ‘disaster fauna’ such as Lystrosaurus, a herbivorous
burrowing synapsid [47,53–55]. Following recovery from the
PTME, archosauromorphs (Sauria), a group that appeared in
the Middle Permian, became the dominant terrestrial animals
[55]. The first marine reptile fossils are known from the Olenekian and were highly diverse by the Anisian, including
basal sauropterygians and ichthyosaurs [56].
Two previous studies have offered perspectives on the distribution of tetrapods across the Permo-Triassic boundary.

(a) Sampling
Raw richness, squares and interpolation estimates produced
similar diversity-through-time curves (electronic supplementary
material, figure S1). The number of collections with terrestrial tetrapod body fossils was relatively consistent through time (Late
Permian, 291; Early Triassic, 307; Middle Triassic, 354), while
the number of collections containing marine tetrapods increased
from the Early to Middle Triassic (Early Triassic, 32; Middle
Triassic, 207). Curves of raw species richness by latitude bin produced by bootstrapping to the same number of collections for
each time interval were near-identical to those using the full
datatset (electronic supplementary material, figure S4).

(b) Terrestrial distribution
Terrestrial tetrapod occurrences were broadly distributed but
clustered throughout the studied interval (figure 1a). Both
squares and interpolation analyses of terrestrial tetrapods by
latitude (figure 1c) show a consistent bimodal richness distribution throughout the Late Permian to Middle Triassic, with a
persistent dip in diversity in the low southern latitudes. In the
Northern Hemisphere, diversity peaked at 40° N in the Late Permian. By the Early Triassic, the peak in species diversity had
shifted to the 20° N bin (figure 1b), with stage-level analyses
indicating this occurred in the Olenekian (electronic supplementary material, figure S2b). In the Middle Triassic, the
Northern Hemisphere peak returned to 40° N. The gradient in
the Southern Hemisphere remained relatively unchanged
throughout the Late Permian to Middle Triassic, characterized
by a consistent 60° S diversity peak.

(c) Marine distribution
Marine tetrapods were generally restricted to the Northern
Hemisphere during the Early and Middle Triassic, despite
having a relatively broad longitudinal distribution (figure 1a).
Early Triassic marine tetrapods were most diverse in the 20° N
bin, with the only other occurrences found in the 40° N bin
(figure 1d). The 20° N peak in biodiversity persisted into the
Middle Triassic, but with new occupation of the equatorial and
20° S bins. The stage-level analyses generally show comparable
trends to those seen in the epoch-level time bins, but often
with fewer bins occupied, producing patchier and less constrained gradients (electronic supplementary material, figure S2).

(d) Comparison with modern latitudinal diversity
gradients
The Early Triassic terrestrial LDG produced by interpolation
was compared to LDGs of modern birds, mammals and
amphibians (figure 2; modern data derived from BiodiversityMapping.org, as used by Saupe et al. [22]). The modern
curves have unimodal distributions that peak at low latitudes
(maximum diversity at 9.5° S for birds and amphibians,
2.5° N for mammals), whereas the Early Triassic terrestrial
curve peaks at higher latitudes, with a clear bimodal
distribution (maximum diversity at 32.5° N and 62.5° S).

4. Discussion
In contrast with gradients for modern terrestrial tetrapods, the
Permo-Triassic terrestrial tetrapod gradient was likely bimodal

Fossil occurrences dated to a single geological stage were used to
produce raw sampled-in-bin tetrapod richness curves.
To compare tetrapod richness patterns across space between the
Late Permian, Early Triassic and Middle Triassic, stage-level
occurrences were binned using 20° latitudinal bands, from 90° S
to 90° N (the central bin includes the equator, from 10° N to 10° S).
Terrestrial and marine body fossils were analysed separately, with
‘marine tetrapods’ referring to species whose morphology indicates
life in marine habitats. This informal group is polyphyletic and
includes basal ichthyosaurs, sauropterygians, tanystropheids and
thalattosaurs.
When reconstructing historical spatial biodiversity patterns,
allowances must be made for the spatio-temporal unevenness
of the fossil record [5,56,64–70]. LDGs in deep time can be estimated if sampling rates in the clade of interest are relatively
high, and consideration is given to partitioning variation in richness likely attributable to sampling biases versus that likely
attributable to biological patterns [71]. Furthermore, subsampling and extrapolation methods can help alleviate issues
of sampling heterogeneity. Coverage-based approaches are currently the most effective approach for mitigating the effects of
fossil record bias in large-scale biodiversity analyses [72,73].
We applied two analytical approaches to account for spatiotemporal sampling biases in occurrence data: coverage-based
interpolation [74,75] and squares [76]. Both were applied to collections within latitudinal bins for the Late Permian, Early
Triassic and Middle Triassic time intervals (analyses were
repeated for individual stages, electronic supplementary
material, figure S2). Only body fossils were used for these analyses, due to the biological non-equivalence of trace fossil and
body fossil species; one animal can produce multiple trace fossils,
and traces are not easily allied to individual body fossil species.
Richness estimates were generated using coverage-based interpolation following the approach of Dunne et al. [77] using the R
package iNEXT [75]. This approach conducts coverage-based rarefaction using the equations of Chao & Jost [74] (analogous to
shareholder quorum subsampling [64,72]) and extrapolation
based on the Chao1 estimator. Extrapolated estimates were
discarded if more than three times the observed sample size, as
this suggests a high species-to-occurrence count ratio that indicates
the bin under consideration is likely to be undersampled [75]. Bins
containing fewer than three species were incompatible with subsampling and therefore excluded from analyses (electronic
supplementary material, table S1). Coverage-based rarefaction
curves are also presented (electronic supplementary material,
figure S3) to illustrate the relationship between coverage and
coverage-standardized diversity estimates in each bin [72,77].
In addition to coverage-based interpolation, richness estimates were generated using the squares method [76]. Squares
is an extrapolator based on the proportion of singletons in a
given sample and is considered more robust to biases arising
from small sample sizes and uneven abundance distributions
than other interpolation methods [73,76]. Squares richness
estimates were produced using the equation stated by Alroy [76].
Finally, we tested whether variation in sampling intensity
among time bins influenced richness estimates, particularly
given the expected reduction in Early Triassic tetrapod occurrences following the PTME. We subsampled to the same
number of collections in each time interval (Late Permian,
Early Triassic and Middle Triassic) using a bootstrap routine.
For each time bin, we randomly sampled 250 collections for terrestrial tetrapods and 30 collections for marine tetrapods.
Collections were allocated to their corresponding latitudinal bin
and species richness was quantified across collections within
each bin. This process was repeated 100 times. Diversity curves
were produced using the mean species diversity in each latitude
bin across the 100 replicates, allowing for comparison of LDGs
among time bins given an artificially fixed sampling intensity.

with reduced diversity at low latitudes (10° N–30° S) (figure 1)
[4,6]. The general shape of the terrestrial tetrapod richness gradient, particularly its bimodality, remained relatively constant
throughout the Late Permian to Middle Triassic and may
reflect the prevailing climate regime (greenhouse versus icehouse) [5,17,31]. Interestingly, the shape of the gradient did
not seem affected by the PTME or even higher temperatures
of the Early Triassic (equatorial SSTs increased from approx.
24° C in the latest Permian to approx. 40° C during the late
Smithian [44]). Marine tetrapods, by contrast, maintained a
diversity peak at low latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere
from the Early to Middle Triassic (figure 1). The bimodal terrestrial LDG obtained here is comparable to the distribution of
raw Early Triassic tetrapod occurrences from Sun et al. [44] and
Bernardi et al. [52], and suggests continuity of LDG shape from
the Middle Permian [58]. The shape of the gradient is also
broadly comparable to the gradient of Mesozoic dinosaurs,
which Mannion et al. [13] attributed to the distribution of
land area during the break-up of Pangaea. This congruence
suggests LDGs may have been bimodal for much of the Permian to mid Cenozoic, with modern LDGs only developing
as global climate gradually cooled through the late Palaeogene
and early Neogene [5,14,15,31].

Although latitude is a reasonable proxy for temperature
in the modern, this relationship does not hold for the Triassic
[41]. The latitudinal temperature gradient today largely
reflects the operation of Hadley cells, but these cells may
have collapsed in the Late Permian to give way to a more
zonally asymmetric atmospheric system, with strong seasonal
variation in temperature and precipitation [40,41,49].
Although the Tethyan coastal regions experienced supermonsoons, considerably less precipitation reached the
continental interior, resulting in high aridity, particularly in
the southern low to mid-latitudes [40,43]. Climate model
reconstructions for the latest Permian suggest large areas of
central Pangaea were desert, with seasonal average temperatures up to 45° C in the arid subtropics at 20–25° N and S [78].
Late Permian palaeoenvironmental evidence from localities
in South Africa indicates considerable drought even at relatively high latitudes (approx. 65° S) [47]. Thus, much of the
supercontinent interior may have been uninhabitable in the
Late Permian, which could explain the bimodal, asymmetric
tetrapod LDG reconstructed here. However, in contrast with
Permian climates, Triassic climates have not been well
studied [41,42], and the development of high-resolution climate models for the Triassic is essential for determining the

key drivers of tetrapod extinction and migration during this
interval.
We cautiously interpret the bimodal richness distributions
found here as biologically meaningful, particularly given the
agreement between the different sampling methodologies
employed. In addition, collections from southern low latitude
regions are consistently of low α-diversity (local diversity)
throughout the entire Late Permian to Middle Triassic, in comparison with some very high levels of α-diversity in mid-latitude
collections during the same intervals (electronic supplementary
material, table S2). However, the spatial and temporal resolution
of the analyses, and our certainty in the observed distributions
representing biological patterns, would benefit from better geographic spread and higher density of samples [67–69]. New
discoveries from the southern low to mid-latitudes could particularly help to distinguish between low biodiversity and
poor sampling, but fossiliferous outcrops of this age and palaeolatitude are uncommon, particularly from terrestrial
environments (electronic supplementary material, figure S5)
[41,49,67]. Although extensive shallow and marginal marine
deposits, such as those in Oman, are rich in invertebrate fossils
(e.g. [79]), vertebrate fossils are known only from a handful of
localities, such as Gour Laoud in Algeria (Jesairosaurus lehmani,
Odenwaldia sp., indeterminate amphibians; palaeolatitude 9° S
[80]) and Mariakani in Kenya (Kenyasaurus mariakaniensis;
palaeolatitude 42° S [81]). Unfortunately, the age of fossils
from these localities is poorly constrained and were therefore
not included in our analyses.
Although broad stasis in bimodal richness gradients was
observed over the approximately 23 million year interval considered here (Late Permian–Middle Triassic), smaller scale
variability can be detected among time bins. Both squares
and interpolation analyses suggest a shift in peak diversity
in the Northern Hemisphere towards the equator in the
Early Triassic, before returning to mid-latitudes in the
Middle Triassic. This shift is also supported by the relatively
high number of trace fossil occurrences in the equatorial and
20° N bins during the Early Triassic (figure 1b). An Early
Triassic equatorward shift in diversity in the Northern Hemisphere seems surprising given that global temperatures were
increasing at the time [44]. Instead, this shift may reflect
differential sampling bias. Most of the interpolation

rarefaction curves are exponential in shape, but the Early
Triassic 20° N bin has a more asymptotic curve (electronic
supplementary material, figure S3), indicating sampling completeness may be substantially higher in this bin relative to
the others, inflating diversity estimates [72]. This peak in
diversity corresponds to the high density of tetrapod fossils
known from the Olenekian of Eastern Europe [82].

5. Conclusion
Our results suggest terrestrial tetrapods exhibited a bimodal
richness distribution and were most diverse at mid-latitudes
during the Late Permian–Middle Triassic. By contrast, marine
tetrapods were generally restricted to northern low latitudes in
the Early and Middle Triassic. Tetrapods were not excluded
from equatorial regions during this interval, but were reduced
in diversity at low southern latitudes. The bimodal LDG for terrestrial tetrapods during the Late Permian–Middle Triassic
contrasts with the unimodal, equatorial diversity peaks exhibited by most terrestrial tetrapod clades in the modern,
including birds, mammals and amphibians (figure 2). PermoTriassic LDGs were likely shaped by the extreme climatic conditions of the time, particularly high global temperatures and
heterogeneous precipitation. As is often the case regarding the
vertebrate fossil record, our data are insufficient to determine
conclusively whether observed patterns predominantly reflect
true biological signal or heterogeneous spatial sampling. Further
examination of Triassic climates and increased sampling intensity may advance our understanding of this time interval,
providing greater insight into the potential influence of extreme
greenhouse conditions on global patterns of biodiversity.

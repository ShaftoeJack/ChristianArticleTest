Terrestrial Middle Triassic strata occur throughout continental Africa and are particularly well exposed in
South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Namibia. The youngest age for all these African deposits is widely accepted as early Middle Triassic (Anisian). Fossils collected recently from the uppermost strata of the upper
Omingonde Formation in Namibia highlighted the presence of Chiniquodon, a carnivorous cynodont previously only found in Ladinian-Carnian aged rocks of South America. In addition, work in progress indicates
that a large archosaur, originally reported as Erythrosuchus, also discovered from levels close to the top of
this unit, is in fact a rauisuchian, a group of archosaurs well known from Ladinian-Carnian beds of southern
South America. Here we present the ﬁrst record of the tuskless dicynodont Stahleckeria potens from the top of
the upper Omingonde Formation in central Namibia. This taxon was up until now only known from the
Ladinian Dinodontosaurus Assemblage Zone of the Santa Maria Formation in southern Brazil. Thus, compelling evidence for a Ladinian age for the upper levels of the upper Omingonde Formation is provided by two
therapsid and one archosaur taxa. The tetrapod fauna of the upper Omingonde Formation partially ﬁlls the
gap of the well-documented hiatus (Ladinian gap), prevalent throughout the Karoo basins of south and central Africa. The presence of the same therapsid taxa in the Namibian Waterberg Basin and the Paraná Basin of
Brazil during Middle Triassic suggests that these basins were biogeographically linked through a series of
interconnecting lowlands, with no major ecological, climatic and/or physical barriers.

1. Introduction
Dicynodonts are a diverse and widespread group of herbivorous therapsids, which constituted a key component of Permian and Triassic terrestrial tetrapod communities throughout Pangea (e.g. King, 1988;
Fröbisch, 2009). In western Gondwana (southern South America and
south-central Africa), dicynodonts are well represented and diverse. Accordingly, they have been extensively used as biostratigraphic markers
mainly to correlate Triassic successions between western Argentina and
southern Brazil and Permo-Triassic strata around south-central Africa
(e.g. Bonaparte, 1966, 1969; Cox, 1968, 1969; Vega-Dias et al., 2004;
Langer et al., 2007; Domnanovich, 2010; Kammerer et al., 2011). Nevertheless, faunal correlations between South America and Africa based on
dicynodonts are scarce. Until recently, Kannemeyeria represented the
only dicynodont taxon shared between Africa (South Africa and Namibia)
and South America (Argentina); however, the taxonomic identiﬁcation of

the Argentinian specimen has been questioned (Renaut and Hancox,
2001).
Conversely, cynodont therapsids have proven to be an important tool
in western Gondwanan correlations, particularly Early-Middle Triassic
strata. A recent revision of cynodonts from the upper part of the Middle
Triassic upper Omingonde Formation of central Namibia found taxonomic links with tetrapod faunas of southern Africa and South America
(Abdala and Smith, 2009). These included the cynodont Luangwa
which is also present in faunas from Zambia and South America, Aleodon,
also known from Tanzania, and the carnivorous cynodont Chiniquodon
which also occurs in South America and Madagascar (Abdala and
Smith, 2009; Kammerer et al., 2010).
To improve our understanding of the palaeobiogeographical connections in western Gondwana during the Middle Triassic we recently conducted ﬁeldwork targeting the uppermost Omingonde strata
exposed along the Omaruru River in central Namibia. Several therapsid fossils were discovered of which the most interesting is the skull
and lower jaw of a relatively large tuskless dicynodont which we
have identiﬁed as Stahleckeria potens, a species previously known
only from a Ladinian-aged interval of the Santa Maria Formation of
southern Brazil. This new specimen constitutes the ﬁrst large tuskless

dicynodont described from the Triassic of Namibia and only the second for the Middle Triassic of Africa. Tuskless dicynodonts are represented by four taxa in the Middle-Late Triassic successions of South
America, one of them, Ischigualastia, being abundant. This new record
not only strengthens correlations between Namibia and southern South
America during early Mesozoic times but also supports previous suggestions of a late Middle Triassic (Ladinian) age for the fauna represented in
the uppermost strata of the upper Omingonde Formation. Accordingly,
these new vertebrate fossils from the upper Omingonde are hitherto
the only positively identiﬁed Ladinian-aged fauna for continental Africa.
2. Geological setting
In southwestern Gondwana, during the Middle Triassic, the large
Karoo foreland basin of South Africa was positioned around 55° S

(Fig. 1) and was bounded by the rising Cape Fold mountains to the
south, east and west and a vast plateau to the north (Visser, 1991;
Turner, 1999; Hancox and Rubidge, 2001; Catuneanu et al., 2005;
Rubidge, 2005; Zerfass et al., 2005). At the same time this plateau was affected by crustal extension that opened up a broad belt of linear rift valleys stretching NE-SW across southern Gondwana (Tankard et al., 2009;
Zerfass et al., 2004; Fig. 1) and it is in these rifts that various Karoo-aged
(Permo- Carboniferous to Early Jurassic) successions have been preserved. The structural trend has been attributed to transtensional
forces in the crust that were being released along deep-seated
pre-Gondwanan sutures (De Wit et al., 1988). Zerfass et al. (2004)
concluded that the en-echelon extensional basins of southern Brazil
and southern African were formed in dextral shear zones subperpendicular to the Gondwanides orogen caused by oblique compression in the Sierra de la Ventana and Cape Fold belts. Alternatively Lofﬂer

(1998) interprets the lineament as a “failed rift” resulting from crustal
upwarping as a precursor to the Early Cretaceous magmatism that accompanied the eventual break-up of western Gondwana.
The Omingonde Formation of central Namibia accumulated in a series
of 3 parallel half-grabens in the region of south-western Gondwana that
lay around 40o S (Fig. 1). These small basins have been named Waterberg
and Erongo on the southern side and Otjungundu on the northern edge
(South African Committee for Stratigraphy, 1980). The fossils and outcrops documented here (Figs. 2 and 3) all lie within the Waterberg
Basin in the area around Mount Etjo (Stollhofen et al., 1998; Holzförster
et al., 1999; Zerfass et al., 2005). Here, the 700 m-thick Karoo-aged succession lies directly on an uneven, glacially sculpted (Lofﬂer, 1998) surface of Neoproterozoic granites and gneisses. The new dicynodont was
recovered from the predominantly red ﬂuvial ﬂoodplain deposits of the
Upper Omingonde Fm., some 40 stratigraphic meters below the base of
the predominantly aeolian Etjo Formation (Fig. 2). Global modeling
(Hallam, 1985), as well as geological (Du Toit, 1948; Smith, 1995) and paleontological data (Grine et al., 1979, but see Kemp, 1982) indicate that
the climate in the interior of western Gondwana during the Middle

1153

Triassic was warm to hot, seasonally arid with mean annual temperatures of between 16 and 20 °C (Smith, 1995; Sellwood and Valdes, 2006).

3. Paleoenvironmental interpretation
In the upper Omingonde succession, the ﬂuvial channel sandstone
bodies gradually lose their gravel component yet retain high sinuosity
characteristics and, as such, may be described as the preserved inchannel deposits of pebbly sand-bed meandering rivers. Fig. 3 is a measured sedimentological section of cliff exposures along the Omaruru
River (see Fig. 2) in the vicinity of the new dicynodont and from which
most of the associated fauna was recovered. This interval corresponds
to the lower half of Unit 4 of Holzförster et al. (1999), which they interpret as ﬂoodplain facies with sheetﬂood deposits. The lower pebbly
sandstone bodies display ribbon-shaped cross-sectional geometry and
lateral accretion surfaces typical of meander-belt point-bar deposits
(Friend, 1983). They have runneled basal scours and comprise mainly
trough cross-bedded, coarse-grained sandstone or gritstone with

scattered maroon mudrock pebbles and lenses of matrix supported
white quartz and rare basaltic pebble conglomerate.
The sandstone-to-mudrock ratio in the logged interval is 1:6. The
overbank ﬁnes are dominantly thickly bedded, pale red, massive siltstone with some horizontally laminated ﬁne-grained sandstone sheets

containing minor mudrock ﬂakes. Colour mottling and horizons of calciﬁed arcuate planes are common in the massive mudrock. These homogenous siltstone beds are interpreted as loessic in origin, each having been
deposited rapidly, possibly in a single duststorm (Pye, 1995), then
overprinted with immature vertisols (Smith and Swart, 2002).

Another taphonomically interesting occurrence is the concentration of
cynodont remains in a 2.5 m thick× 40 m wide cliff exposure of loessic
siltstones (see Fig. 2, OM 2–3, 5–7 and 14–19; Table 1). The 10 specimens are mostly traversodontids and one chiniquodontid, showing a
range of body sizes with all states of disarticulation and all are preserved
without any calcareous nodular encrustation. Their distribution is clearly associated with the top and margins of a narrow, ﬁne-grained, shoestring channel-ﬁll sandstone. Thus, it is proposed that vegetation along
the channel banks attracted the animals to this ﬂoodplain depression,
which then promoted rapid burial of their carcasses by acting as a
loess trap.

Large sized tuskless dicynodont presenting the following combination
of characters: skull wider than longer, snout robust and blunt, frontal
with narrow anterior processes intruding between the nasals; interorbital
skull roof very wide, with orbits not visible in dorsal view, postorbital
region reduced representing less than the 40% of the cranial length,
intertemporal skull roof remarkably wide, mostly formed by the parietal,
and positioned approximately horizontal in lateral view, preparietal absent, occipital plate vertical and remarkably widened by the lateral extension of the squamosal wings (which form almost half of the width of the
occiput).

There is no original speciﬁc diagnosis for Stahleckeria potens. The only
available diagnosis is for Stahleckeria and was presented by Keyser and
Cruickshank (1979). Some characters proved to be problematical after
the new detailed anatomical study and reconstruction of the skull of S.
potens by Maisch (2001). The diagnosis above presented for S. potens includes diagnostic features proposed by Maisch (2001) for Stahleckeriidae
Lehman, 1961, and Stahleckeriinae Lehman, 1961.

4.4. Paralectotype

The vertical proﬁle through the new dicynodont locality (Fig. 3)
shows that most of the vertebrate fossils in these strata are found in the
dark red (10YR3/6) massive siltstone overbank facies. It is interpreted
that many of these tetrapod remains, including the new dicynodont
(0M-10) described here, were buried as disarticulated but associated
skeletons beneath layers of loessic silt dumped on the ﬂoodplain surface
during windstorms. The new dicynodont skull is distorted due to it having been buried in an unusual postero-lateral-up attitude which is attributed to the “self burial” mechanism that is common on windswept
loessic plains (Behrensmeyer, 1975). Isolated and abraded transported
post-cranial elements (OM 21–23), and very rarely more fully articulated
skeletons, such as the skull and disarticulated but still associated post
crania of a medium sized cynodont (OM-13) and the large semiarticulated rauisuchid skeleton (OM-4), are found within the upper
levels of coarser-grained ephemeral stream channel ﬁlls (see Fig. 3).

4.7. Locality and horizon
The specimen was collected from low exposures on the eastern
bank of the Omaruru River (S 21° 03.141, E 16° 23.634), Otjiwarongo
District, central Namibia (Fig. 2). Stratigraphically the specimen lies
40 m below the base of the Etjo Formation in strata assigned to the
Unit 4 of the upper Omingonde Formation by Holzförster et al.
(1999) and considered to be of Middle Triassic age (Abdala and
Smith, 2009).

5.1.1. General preservation
The specimen shows a strong postero-lateral distortion that affected
particularly the left side, which has suffered from compaction and thus
appears to be antero-posteriorly elongated (Figs. 4a and b). The occipital
plate on the left side is also remarkably deformed (Fig. 4d). This distortion
has resulted in the loss of bilateral symmetry in the skull (see asterisks in
Figs. 4a and b) and mandible. In spite of this, the bone tissue structure is
well preserved and several sutures can be traced in one or both sides of
the skull.

5.1.2. Dorsal view
The skull is fairly wide, with the maximum width across the squamosals of approximately 420 mm and the basal skull length of circa
360 mm. The postorbital length is shorter than the length between the
tip of the snout and the pineal foramen (Fig. 4a). The facial surface of
the premaxilla, maxillae, nasals and prefrontals is ornamented by coarse
rugosities that are particularly well developed on the premaxilla, where
there is also a low longitudinal crest. The snout is short (approximately
one third of the length of the skull) and blunt. The premaxilla has a
‘V’-shaped contact with the nasals and behind this contact the nasals
form a short suture, thus preventing a premaxilla-frontal contact. The
interorbital region is particularly wide so that the orbits are not visible
in dorsal view (Fig. 4a). The temporal openings are nearly rounded,
slightly wider than long, and the intertemporal bar is antero-posteriorly
short and also wide (Fig. 4a). The pineal foramen is located just behind
the anterior margin of the temporal openings. The frontals are projected
posteriorly thus forming the anterolateral margin of the pineal foramen,
and extend laterally, between the prefrontals and postorbitals, into the
dorsal margin of the orbits (Fig. 4a). The parietals are small, nearly
pentagonal-shaped bones, located in the middle part of the intertemporal
bar at the same level of the bones forming the margins of the temporal
openings. The anterior margin of the interparietal is bilobed and a medial
suture is visible in dorsal view (Fig. 4a) and in the upper third in occipital
view, thus indicating it is a paired bone, a condition unusual in therapsids,
but present in Stahleckeria potens (see Maisch, 2001). The postorbitals
make up the postorbital bar presenting a long posterior process onto
the dorsal medial border of the temporal opening, reaching the squamosals and interparietals.
5.1.3. Palatal view
The palate is nearly 40% of the total length of the skull and is formed
by the premaxilla that bears a pair of low longitudinal ridges anteriorly
(Fig. 4b). These ridges fade away posteriorly where only a strong medial
ridge is present. The medial margin of the maxilla is excluded from the
margin of the internal nares by the palatine. The choanae are elongated
and wide, surrounded by palatines, pterygoids and, in the midline, by
the vomer. The vomer also limits anteriorly a rounded interpterygoid vacuity (Fig. 4b). Behind the vacuity the pterygoids contact widely forming
a ﬂat and smooth surface. The remaining bones of the basicranium are
covered by displaced postcranial elements, including a vertebra and
other unrecognized bones (Fig. 4b). In ventral view, the infraorbital bar
is formed mostly by the maxilla and medially by the jugal, whereas the
zygomatic arch has a large contribution of the squamosal. Both quadrates
are preserved and bear broad and wide articular facets separated by a
shallow central trough. The left stapes is poorly preserved but is possible
to observe the absence of a stapedial foramen (Fig. 4b).
5.1.4. Lateral view
The septomaxilla borders the posterior margin of the external nares;
thus, there is no inclusion of the lacrimal in the border of the nares. As a

consequence of deformation, the nasals protrude and overhang the
nares, partially obscuring them in lateral view (Fig. 4c). The maxillae
are relatively broad, triangular bones bearing strong tuskless, ventrally
projected maxillary processes located at the level of the anterior border
of the orbit and oriented nearly vertical (Fig. 4c). The prefrontals are
nearly rectangular-shaped, forming the anterior half of the dorsal margin of the orbit (Fig. 4c). The lacrimal has a well-developed facial portion and a posterior projection that forms the anteroventral margin of
the orbit and contacts a thin jugal, which represents the posteroventral
margin orbital. A digitated suture between the maxilla and the squamosal is clearly represented at the level of the posterior margin of the orbit.
A partially preserved, thin epipterygoid and prootic are representing
the lateral wall of the skull. There is a long horizontal suture between
the ventral portion of the epipterygoid and the pterygoid.
5.1.5. Occipital view
The occipital plate is vertical with the ﬂaring lateral ﬂanges of the
squamosals (Fig. 4d). The occiput is approximately two times wider
than high, with a relatively narrow foramen magnum and a robust and
wide occipital condyle (Fig. 4d). Only in a restricted area near the dorsal
margin of the interparietals is it possible to recognize the suture between
these bones on occipital view. The interparietals occupy a relative extended area on the dorsal part of the plate and extend ventrally forming
a V-shape suture with the supraoccipital. This bone contacts ventrally
with a large paroccipital process. Both bones and also possibly the squamosal contribute to form the margin of a tiny postemporal foramen.
There is a lateroventral projection of the paroccipital process which
ends close to the medial border of the quadrate trochlea (Fig. 4d). The
lateral margin of the paroccipital process is separated from the squamosal by a well-developed crest. The squamosals are broad and greatly contribute to extend laterally the occipital plate (Fig. 4d).
5.2. Mandible
Both rami of the lower jaw are nearly complete but the right ramus is
severely affected by deformation, being approximately two-thirds of the
length of the left ramus. The dentary is a massive bone with a dorsally
projected and pointed anterior tip (Fig. 5A). The labial surface of the
dentary is coarsely rugose as is the surface of the snout. The dorsal surface of the dentary shows two parallel longitudinal ridges along its
length, with the medial one higher than the lateral. In lateral view the
dentary develops two posterior processes, the dorsal, in contact with
the surangular, and the ventral, forming a spur that is contacted by the
angular (Fig. 5A). Surangular and angular enclose the mandibular foramen laterally. The angular extends posteriorly in a long, ﬂat reﬂected
lamina, which nearly reaches the retroarticular process (Fig. 5, A and
B). This process is partially deformed but it possible to conﬁrm that it
bends downwards. The articular surface for the quadrate trochlea is
long and wide, showing a longitudinal crest that divides the surface in
the lateral and medial areas (Fig. 5B). In medial view, the mandibular

1158

foramen is limited by the surangular dorso-anteriorly and by the
prearticular, ventrally (Fig. 5B).
6. Discussion
6.1. Taxonomy
The new tuskless Namibian dicynodont is here assigned to the
Brazilian species Stahleckeria potens. This assignation is based on the
presence in the Namibian specimen of a mixture of diagnostic characters of Stahleckeriidae and Stahleckeriinae that are typical of S. potens
(see comments in diagnosis above): presence of a skull wider than longer, a snout robust and blunt, an interorbital region extremely wide
with the orbits not visible in dorsal view, a postorbital region reduced
representing less than the 40% of the cranial length, an intertemporal
bar remarkably wide (mostly formed by the parietal) and positioned
approximately horizontal in lateral view, and the presence of the vertical occipital plate which is distinctively widened by the lateral extension of the squamosal wings.
Most of the recent phylogenetic analyses that included Triassic dicynodonts (kannemeyeriiforms) consistently recovered a monophyletic
Stahleckeriidae (Maisch, 2001; Vega-Dias et al., 2004; Damiani et al.,
2007; Kammerer et al., 2011), a group of dicynodonts which includes
the Brazilian Stahleckeria, the South American Jachaleria, the Argentinean
Ischigualastia, the North American Placerias, the Zambian Sangusaurus,
the Namibian Dolichuranus and the African Angonisaurus (Fig. 6). The
ﬁrst four genera were recovered in all the hypotheses (Fig. 6), the only
exception being that of Damiani et al. (2007) in which Jachaleria and

Placerias were not included in the analysis. In addition, Maisch's (2001:
145) taxonomic arrangement of Stahleckeriinae includes the African dicynodonts Angonisaurus and, with some reservations, Zambiasaurus.
Vega-Dias et al. (2004) included the South African taxon Angonisaurus
that was recovered as the sister-taxon of Stahleckeria; however, in a
more recent phylogenetic analysis Angonisaurus resulted in a basal position outside Stahleckeriidae (Kammerer et al., 2011; see Fig. 6). The same
occurred with the Namibian taxon Dolichuranus which was considered
the sister-taxon of the clade Stahleckeriidae (Damiani et al., 2007), but
was recovered as a basal kannemeyeriiform by Kammerer et al. (2011).
The later authors found a sister group relationships between Stahleckeria
and Sangusaurus from Zambia (Fig. 6), a taxon usually considered among
kannemeyeriids (Cox, 1969; Keyser and Cruickshank, 1979) or as incertae
sedis (Cox and Li, 1983; King, 1988). Kammerer et al. (2011: 135) however caution that the Zambian taxon is poorly known and mostly coded
with “?” for the synapomorphies supporting stahleckeriids.
The Namibian Stahleckeria shows clear differences with these proposed most-closely related taxa. The Namibian Dolichuranus shows,
among other differences with Stahleckeria, the presence of tusks and
of nasal bosses, a narrow intertemporal bar oriented dorsally, an
interpterygoid vacuity placed posteriorly and near to the posterior
margin of the temporal opening, the presence of a postorbital process
that contributes to the suborbital bar anteriorly, and a prominent
processus depressor mandibulae on a well-developed ventral tympanic
ridge (Damiani et al., 2007). The skull morphology of Zambiasaurus,
considered by some authors as closely related to Stahleckeria, was
interpreted from eighty-ﬁve separate skull fragments (Cox, 1969). The
principal differences of this taxon with Stahleckeria is that Zambiasaurus

presents a narrow and longer intertemporal region, the frontal is on the
anterior dorsal margin of the orbits (Cox, 1969: Fig. 20B), there is a
sharp transition between dorsal and occipital surfaces and the squamosal wings of the occiput are extended laterally and somewhat posteriorly (Cox, 1969: 260). All these differences should be considered with
caution, because Zambiasaurus is not only based in fragmentary material, but they are most likely of juveniles (Cox, 1969).
Sangusaurus is represented for a few cranial fragments, the most
signiﬁcant being an incomplete intertemporal bar, a partial premaxilla and a partial maxilla (Cox, 1969: Figs. 21–23). Differences with
Stahleckeria include the presence of a low boss behind the pineal foramen and intertemporal bar directed postero-dorsally (this last character contingent of a correct interpretation of directionality in the
intertemporal fragment; Cox, 1969: 289). In addition, the intertemporal
bar appears to be narrower in Sangusaurus.
Major differences with Angonisaurus is that the latter has a caniniform
process with a stout and straight posterior edge, an intertemporal bar tapering upwards to a narrow crest, a postorbital region of the skull longer
than preorbital, strong nasal bosses, and an occiput slightly oblique (Cox
and Li, 1983). Another partial skull, identiﬁed as Angonisaurus, was also
described for the youngest sub-assemblage of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone in South Africa (Hancox and Rubidge, 1996). Differences
between this specimen and the Namibian Stahleckeria include the presence of a deep triangular depression including, anteriorly, the extremely
large pineal foramen in the South African taxon, also the presence of two
strong diverging crests in the posterior portion of the temporal region,
and a frontal occupying most of the dorsal margin of the orbit. The Argentinean dicynodont Ischigualastia is strikingly different from the Namibian
Stahleckeria, including, among other differences, a long and narrow
intertemporal bar, a convex dorsal margin of the occiput and a pointed
snout (Domnanovich, 2010). Clear differences between Stahleckeria and
Placerias are the presence of a sharp snout, pronounced upright temporal
bar, comparative longer postorbital region, the extreme development of a
blade-like caniniform process with reduced canines and short parietal
process of the postorbital extending only to the level of the pineal foramen in the Late Triassic taxon from USA (Keyser and Cruickshank,
1979). Finally, the Late Triassic Jachaleria from South America also differs
markedly from Stahleckeria. Jachaleria shows an extra bone between nasals and frontals, well-developed rugosities in the orbital margins of the
prefrontals and postorbitals, a furrow on the dorsal face of the postorbital,
a horizontal ventral margin of the maxilla in lateral view, a narrow
intertemporal bar which is upright in relation to the interorbital bar,
and the presence of a preparietal bone in front of the pineal foramen
(Vega-Dias and Schultz, 2004; Domnanovich, 2010).
In summary, the new specimen described herein constitutes a new
representative of Stahleckeria potens only known, until now, from specimens collected from the Santa Maria Formation of southern Brazil. The
only difference between the Brazilian specimens and the individual
from Namibia is in their size. The largest Brazilian specimen has a
basal skull length of 490 mm (Cox and Li, 1983), against the 360 mm
of the Namibian skull, thus being approximately 27% smaller. Size per
se is not a reliable indicator of taxonomic distinction, and could simply
indicate ontogenetic-age difference, a feature that has already been observed amongst the Brazilian specimens (Vega-Dias et al., 2005).
6.2. Biostratigraphy and correlations
The Middle Triassic fauna from the upper Omingonde Formation was
originally described by Keyser (1973a,b). The fauna included several
cynodont and dicynodont therapsids and a temnospondyl amphibian.
Dicynodonts were important components in the ﬁrst discoveries by
Keyser (1973a,b), who recognized Kannemeyeria, a typical representative of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone of the main Karoo Basin in
South Africa (Keyser, 1973a,b). However he also proposed a slightly
younger age for the Namibian fauna based on the presence of the large
cynodont Titanogomphodon and some dicynodonts presenting more

1159

advanced characters than the South African. In addition, Keyser (1973a)
interpreted the Omingonde Formation as older than the Manda and
upper Ntawere Formations because of the absence of traversodontid
cynodonts. Since 1973 at least three research teams have conducted
ﬁeldwork on the Omingonde outcrops, which has resulted in the discovery of several new taxa. There has also been a critical review by one of the
authors (FA) of the identiﬁcation and stratigraphic position of all the fossils collected to date. The new records included several cynodonts, mostly
represented by traversodontids, and a large archosaur, all collected from
the upper part of what was deﬁned as the upper Omingonde Formation
(Pickford, 1995; Holzförster et al., 1999; Smith and Swart, 2002). The
age of the Omingonde Formation was considered to be lower Middle Triassic (Anisian) based on faunal correlations with the main Karoo Basin,
and the east African Ruhuhu and Luangwa basins. A recent taxonomic review of a series of cynodonts collected by Smith and Swart (2002) has
identiﬁed a heterogeneous mixture of cynodonts in the fossil assemblages from the top of the upper Omingonde Formation. This mixture included cynodonts known from Anisian levels of Tanzania and Zambia but
also from the Ladinian of South America (Abdala and Smith, 2009).
The most striking ﬁnding was the presence of Chiniquodon, a typical
Ladinian-Carnian cynodont from South America, recently described
from Ladinian-Carnian strata of Madagascar (Kammerer et al., 2010). In
addition, the archosaur skeleton originally interpreted as Erythrosuchus
(Pickford, 1995), a typical taxon from the Cynognathus AZ of South Africa,
has been re-identiﬁed as a rauisuchid (Abdala and Smith, 2009; Arcucci
and Smith, 2011), a group well represented in Ladinian-Carnian faunas
of South America. Accordingly, Abdala and Smith (2009) suggested the
possibility that the fauna represented in the uppermost part of the
upper Omingonde Formation was of upper Middle Triassic (Ladinian)
age (Fig. 7).
Until now, continental Ladinian strata were unknown from southern
Africa (Hancox, 2000), where a regional tectonic unconformity separates
the top of the Beaufort Group from the overlying Molteno Fm. (see
Catuneanu et al., 2005). In this context, the Omingonde Fm. tetrapods
are the only representatives of this age in the entire region and they partially ﬁll the gap between the Early-Middle Triassic Beaufort Group
therapsid-dominated faunas and the Late Triassic Elliot Formation
dinosaur-dominated faunas. This ﬁnding is therefore of great importance
in understanding the evolution of the tetrapod faunas in this part of western Gondwana during the Triassic.
From the Middle Triassic faunas of east Africa, the Lifua Member of the
Manda Fm. has yielded traversodontid cynodonts with postcanine teeth
morphologically similar to Anisian forms and some taxon with the dentition resembling Ladinian and Carnian forms (Abdala and Ribeiro, 2003).
Based on these differences of features in the dentition of traversodontid
species it was proposed that different ages were represented in the
Manda fauna and that the youngest fauna might be Ladinian (Fig. 7;
Abdala et al., 2005). However, this conclusion was only based on differences in evolutionary stages of the dentition of cynodonts, not in the
presence of taxa shared with Ladinian faunas. Recent ﬁeld trips to the
Ruhuhu Basin resulted in numerous new fossil ﬁndings (Sidor et al.,
2008; Sidor, 2011) whose study will provide additional evidence for
the presence of putative Ladinian faunas in Tanzania.
The Middle Triassic faunas from South America includes the
Puesto Viejo fauna from Mendoza Province, Argentina which has records of Cynognathus and Diademodon, cynodonts also known from
the Cynognathus AZ of South Africa and the assemblages of lower
and middle levels of the upper Omingonde Formation. The Puesto Viejo
fauna is generally interpreted as Anisian (Fig. 7; Martinelli et al., 2009).
A second fauna from Mendoza Province is recorded in the Cerro de las
Cabras Formation. This endemic fauna is usually correlated to the Puesto
Viejo Assemblage (Martinelli et al., 2009). Recent radiometric dates are
consistent with an Anisian age for the fossil assemblage of the Cerro de
las Cabras Formation (Fig. 7; Ávila et al., 2006; Abdala et al., 2009). The
Chañares fauna from the Ischigualasto-Villa Union Basin, north-western
Argentina show traversodontid cynodonts more advanced than those

from the Puesto Viejo and the Cerro de las Cabras faunas and an explosive radiation of archosauriforms (Abdala et al., 2009). In Brazil, the
Dinodontosaurus assemblage zone of the Santa Maria Formation is considered contemporaneous to the Chañares fauna because they share
several taxa at genus level (e.g. Massetognathus, Dinodontosaurus). Dicynodonts are abundant in the Brazilian fauna, with Dinodontosaurus
pedroanum being by far the most common taxon represented by hundreds of specimens. Another dicynodont known from this Brazilian assemblage zone is the large tuskless Stahleckeria potens which is only
known by ﬁve specimens (Maisch, 2001; Vega-Dias et al., 2005). Strata
of the Santa Maria Formation bearing fauna of the Dinodontosaurus assemblage zone are considered as Ladinian (Fig. 7; Langer et al., 2007).
The description herein of the dicynodont Stahleckeria potens from
Namibia strengthens the Ladinian age hypothesis advanced by Abdala
and Smith (2009) for the fauna represented in the uppermost part of
the upper Omingonde Formation. In this context, there is no paleontological evidence suggesting an age younger than Ladinian for these strata in contrast with suggestions by Holzförster et al. (1999: Fig. 2) and
Zerfass et al. (2005: Fig. 2).
Stahleckeria is the ﬁrst mid-Triassic dicynodont to be found in both
Namibia (Waterberg Basin) and Brazil (Paraná Basin). This evidence
together with the common presence of the cynodont Chiniquodon in
the same strata (Abdala and Smith, 2009) strongly suggests faunal interchange between these two regions of western Gondwana during middle
Triassic times. The interchange not only involved medium-sized carnivorous animals but also relatively large specialized herbivores. This suggests
that there were no major ecological, climatic and/or physical barriers to
faunal migration before the opening of the south Atlantic in this part of
southwestern Gondwana during the pre-rift phase (Macdonald et al.,
2003), and the vegetation was similar (Spalletti et al., 2003), stable and
relatively continuous in the lowlands that linked both basins.

7. Conclusion
A new relatively large tuskless dicynodont is described for the upper
Omingonde Formation (central Namibia) and it is identiﬁed as a new
specimen of Stahleckeria potens, previously known only from Ladinianaged strata of the Santa Maria Formation of southern Brazil (Paraná
Basin). This new ﬁnding together with the co-occurrence of the cynodont
Chiniquodon and a rauisuchian archosaur supports a Ladinian age of deposition for the uppermost unit of the upper Omingonde Fm. A welldocumented hiatus, dubbed the “Ladinian gap,” is prevalent throughout
the Karoo basins of south and central Africa, which means that the
fauna described here, is the ﬁrst conﬁrmed Ladinian-aged terrestrial
fauna from this region.
Stahleckeria is the only dicynodont proven to occur in Middle Triassic rocks from central Namibia and southern Brazil and as such constitutes the ﬁrst correlation between these two Gondwanan basins
based on this group of large therapsids. This ﬁnding, together with
the common presence of the cynodont Chiniquodon, suggests a degree
of faunal interchange during Middle Triassic (Ladinian) times, which
included both small carnivores and relatively large specialized herbivores
and that a relatively stable lowland vegetation belt existed between these
basins with no major ecological, climatic and/or physical barriers.

Abstract
The Cynognathus Assemblage Zone is the youngest tetrapod biozone of the Beaufort Group (Tarkastad Subgroup,
Karoo Supergroup). It is situated between the underlying Lystrosaurus declivis Assemblage Zone and the base of the
overlying Molteno Formation (Stormberg Group) and corresponds to the entire Burgersdorp Formation. It is
characterised by the presence throughout of the cynodont genus Cynognathus. The biozone reaches a maximum
thickness of around 650 m in the southeast part of the basin and thins dramatically to the north, where it is only a
maximum of 50 m thick. We here propose a three-fold subdivision into a lower Langbergia-Garjainia Subzone, a
middle Trirachodon-Kannemeyeria Subzone and an upper Cricodon-Ufudocyclops Subzone. The basal contact is
deﬁned biostratigraphically by the ﬁrst appearance of Cynognathus crateronotus and Langbergia modisei. The
Cynognathus Assemblage Zone lacks a deﬁned biostratigraphic upper limit, being unconformably terminated by
the base of the overlying Molteno Formation, which lacks a terrestrial vertebrate fossil record other than trackways.

Proposer of name
The Cynognathus Zone was erected by Broom (1906a) and
corresponds to Seeley’s (1892) Zone of specialised theriodonts.
Broom’s (1906a) Cynognathus Zone nomenclature was accepted
by Kitching (1970, 1972, 1977). Kitching (1995) ﬁrst used the
term Cynognathus Assemblage Zone.

This assemblage zone overlies the Lystrosaurus Assemblage
Zone.
Lithostratigraphic position
The Cynognathus Assemblage Zone is coincident with the
Burgersdorp Formation.

Derivation of name
The Cynognathus Assemblage Zone is named after the cynodont
genus Cynognathus (Figure 1). This genus is relatively common,
especially in the middle part of its stratigraphic range, and is
distinctive, even in the ﬁeld. In South Africa it is represented by a
single species, C. crateronotus (Seeley, 1895a, b; Wynd et al., 2018).
Historical background
Based on his trip to South Africa in 1889 the Cynognathus
Assemblage Zone was ﬁrst recognised by Harry Govier Seeley
in 1892 as the Zone of specialised theriodonts (Seeley,
1892). Broom (1906a, 1907, 1909a) formulated a more precise
biostratigraphic division of the fossiliferous horizons of the
Beaufort Group and in his scheme Seeley’s Zone of specialised
theriodonts was renamed the Cynognathus Zone, and this was
accepted by Kitching (1970, 1972, 1977).
Keyser and Smith (1978) introduced the terminology
Kannemeyeria Assemblage Zone to replace the Cynognathus
Zone. The dicynodont Kannemeyeria was preferred over
Cynognathus as the zone’s index fossil as the authors believed
that Cynognathus was rare, and that it was impossible to
accurately establish its biostratigraphic range. They furthermore
argued that Kannemeyeria specimens were larger, more
abundant and more easily recognisable in the ﬁeld. Using a
dicynodont genus was also in line with the practice for the
biozonation of the rest of the Beaufort Group at that time. They
did, however, note that complete skulls of Kannemeyeria were
not common. The Kannemeyeria Assemblage Zone was reﬁned
to the Kannemeyeria-Diademodon Assemblage Zone by Keyser
(1979) and this nomenclature was formally accepted by the
South African Committee for Stratigraphy (SACS, 1980).
Kitching (1984) reassessed the biozonation of the Beaufort
Group as accepted by the South African Committee For
Stratigraphy (SACS, 1980) and proposed the name CynognathusDiademodon Assemblage Zone for the KannemeyeriaDiademodon Assemblage Zone of SACS (1980). His reinstatement of Cynognathus as the zone’s index fossil was based
on his belief that the genus occurred throughout the biozone,
and that it was abundant in collections worldwide. Diademodon
was preferred over Kannemeyeria as an associated index
fossil because it was the most abundant genus in the
biozone (Kitching, 1977). To bring this biozone in line with
internationally recognised nomenclature, Kitching (1995) reassigned the assemblage zone to the historically important genus
Cynognathus, creating the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone.
Early workers who collected in the Cynognathus Assemblage
Zone included Thomas Bain, Alfred (Gogga) Brown and Daniel
Kannemeyer. Published accounts of their discoveries are given
in Seeley (1888, 1889, 1892, 1894, 1895a and b, 1904, 1907, 1908a
and b) and Broom (1903, 1905, 1906a, b, c and d, 1913a and b).
Brown in particular made an enormous contribution to the
knowledge of the fauna and ﬂora of the biozone, and his
collecting trips and localities are recorded in his twenty-one
volume unpublished journal. He is credited with numerous
discoveries including the amphibian Batrachosuhus browni

218

(Broom, 1903), the captorhinid (parareptile) Thelegnathus browni
(Broom, 1905), the archosauriform Erythrosuchus africanus
(Broom 1906b), the enigmatic Palacrodon browni (Broom,
1906c), the rhynchosaurs Howesia browni (Broom, 1905, 1906d)
and Mesosuchus browni (Watson, 1912), as well as numerous ﬁsh
(Broom, 1909b) and plant fossils (Anderson and Anderson, 1985).
In his later life Brown employed Albert William Higgins to collect
for him, to whom is credited the discovery of the archosauriform
Euparkeria capensis (Broom, 1913a and b; Ewer, 1965).
In 1889 Bain introduced Seeley to Brown and Kannemeyer.
Kannemeyer, a medical doctor who lived in Burgersdorp, is
remembered for the numerous skulls of Kannemeyeria
(Weithofer, 1888) he collected from this area. From his trip
to South Africa and the meeting with Kannemeyer and
Brown, Seeley (1904, 1907, 1908a and b) described a number
of Cynognathus Assemblage Zone vertebrate taxa.
Watson (1942) was the ﬁrst to suggest a possible subdivision
of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone, based on the
biostratigraphic ranges of Kannemeyeria and Erythrosuchus as
they were then understood. He subdivided the zone into a lower
zone (A), in which Kannemeyeria and Erythrosuchus occurred
together, and an upper zone (B), in which Kannemeyeria
was absent and Erythrosuchus was extremely rare. This
biostratigraphic range for Kannemeyeria was corroborated by
Kitching (1977) and Cooper (1982), but refuted by Keyser and
Smith (1978) who believed that Kannemeyeria occurred
throughout the biozone. Cooper (1982) felt that Kannemeyeria
was restricted to the lower half of the Burgersdorp Formation,
and further suggested that the upper part of the Cynognathus
Assemblage Zone, above the biostratigraphic range of
Kannemeyeria, would eventually yield an advanced fauna,
equivalent to his Tetragonias Zone fauna. He also considered
the cynodont genera Cynognathus and Diademodon to occur
throughout the range of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone. It
should be noted that these trends were for the Cynognathus
Assemblage Zone as known at the time, and before the
recognition of the lowermost and uppermost subzone faunas
(Kitching, 1977; Keyser and Smith, 1978; Cooper, 1982).
The early studies of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone
were limited to the Eastern Cape, southeastern Free State and
Lesotho (Watson, 1914; Kitching, 1963; Smith, 1990) and prior
to the 1990s these were the only areas in which the biozone
was believed to occur. Kitching (1977, p.26) in fact explicitly
states that “although the Beaufort beds have been carefully
examined in a number of areas in the Wepener, Thaba Nchu,
Ladybrand, Senekal, Bethlehem and Harrismith districts for the
purpose of determining the extent of the Cynognathus Zone
northwards in the Orange Free State, no fossil reptiles or
sediments were found that could be assigned to the zone. At
present it seems that there was no continuous deposition of the
Cynognathus Zone to the north of Wepener”.
Du Toit (1918) was the ﬁrst to consider the uppermost
sedimentary rocks of the Tarkastad Subgroup in the northeastern
Free State to be a continuation of part of the Burgersdorp
Formation in the southern Karoo Basin. This idea was expanded
by Van Eeden (1937), who believed the Burgersdorp Formation
to be present in the vicinity of Bethlehem and Kestell in

the north of the basin. Groenewald (1984, 1989, 1990, 1996)
accepted du Toit’s claims, but argued that there was sufﬁcient
lithological difference between the deposits in the south and
north of the basin to warrant separate formational distinction,
and proposed the name Driekoppen Formation for the northern
equivalents of the Burgersdorp Formation. Only the Burgersdorp
Formation is however currently formally accepted (SACS, 1980;
Johnson and Hiller, 1990), and the northern sequence is now
considered sufﬁciently similar to the Burgersdorp Formation in
the south to warrant its inclusion as a northern, distal facies
(Hancox, 1998; Neveling, 2004).
Welman et al. (1991) provided what they believed to be the
ﬁrst palaeontological evidence to corroborate the proposed
time equivalency of the southern and northern Burgersdorp
Formation exposures, when they reported the presence of
Cynognathus Assemblage Zone fossils from the northeastern
and northwestern Free State. Their faunal list for the northern
Burgersdorp Formation sites included the capitosaurid
temnospondyl Parotosuchus, the archosaur Erythrosuchus,
the cynodonts Cynognathus and Trirachodon, and the
therocephalian Bauria, and they concluded that this represented
a typical Cynognathus Assemblage Zone fauna. Re-assessment
of this material has however shown that the archosaur material
is assignable to the erythrosuchid Garjainia (Gower et al., 2014)
and that the temnospondyl material assigned by Welman et al.
(1991) to Parotosuchus is in fact Kestrosaurus (Shishkin et al.,
2004), the most common faunal element of the northern
Cynognathus Assemblage Zone exposures. Abdala et al. (2006)
further re-assigned the material assigned to Trirachodon to a
new genus Langbergia. Unfortunately, the material assigned to
Bauria, which was described by King (1996), was not included

in the Abdala et al. (2014) re-assessment of the taxonomy of
the South African Bauriidae, but it is likely that this material
is actually assignable to Microgomphodon.
Subsequent to the work of Welman et al. (1991) the northern
Burgersdorp Formation exposures have been the focus of
additional sedimentological and stratigraphic studies by Azzie
(1994), Hancox et al. (1995), Hancox (1998, 2000), Groenewald
et al. (2001) and Neveling (2002). Accounts of new fossil material
include those of Shishkin and Welman (1994), King (1996),
Damiani (1999, 2001a), Gow (1999), Groenewald et al. (2001),
Damiani and Jeannot (2002), Bender and Hancox (2003, 2004),
Shishkin et al. (2004), Abdala et al. (2007), Yates et al. (2012),
Gaetano et al. (2012), Gower et al. (2014) and Jenkins (2018).
In the early 1990s collecting in the southernmost reaches of
the Burgersdorp Formation began to show that a new, distinct
fauna was present in the uppermost part of the Formation as
well (Hancox and Rubidge, 1994). Material from this level has
subsequently been described by Hancox and Rubidge (1996),
Hancox (1998), Hancox et al. (2000), Hancox et al. (2013) and
Kammerer et al. (2019).
Based on the new collecting in the Burgersdorp Formation
in the north and south of the basin, Hancox et al. (1995)
published a brief paper proposing an informal threefold
subdivision of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone based on
the spatial and temporal distribution of mastodonsaurid
temnospondyls and associated vertebrates. The original ideas
behind this subdivision grew out of the description of a northern
Cynognathus Assemblage Zone fauna by Welman et al. (1991),
and the early ﬁndings of Hancox and Rubidge (1994) and
Shishkin et al. (1995). This tripartite subdivision has found
widespread acceptance in the literature (e.g. Hopson and

subdivision in their correlations, no formal subdivision of the
Cynognathus Assemblage Zone has been published.
Field-based research and taxonomic revisions of various
South African fauna over the past two decades has vastly
increased understanding of the rocks and fossils of the
Burgersdorp Formation, to the extent that a formal
biostratigraphic subdivision of the Cynognathus Assemblage
Zone is now possible. The fauna of the redeﬁned Cynognathus
Assemblage Zone represents the later stages of recovery from
the end-Permian mass extinction in the main Karoo Basin
(Roopnarine et al. 2018).

Palaeontology
Description of the Assemblage Zone
An assemblage zone characterised by the occurrence of
the cynodont genus Cynognathus. The Cynognathus Assemblage
Zone is here subdivided into three subzones, a lower LangbergiaGarjainia Subzone, a middle Trirachodon-Kannemeyeria Subzone
(equivalent to the entire Cynognathus Assemblage Zone
as described by Kitching, 1995) and an upper CricodonUfudocyclops Subzone (Figure 2).
The list of fossil taxa is derived from reliably identiﬁed
specimens. Taxonomic and stratigraphic information is derived
from work by the authors and from the following sources:
Hutchinson (1973, 1975, 1978), Jubb and Gardiner (1975),
Grifﬁth (1978), and Bender and Hancox (2003, 2004) for the

Langbergia-Garjainia Subzone
Proposer of name
This subzone is proposed for the ﬁrst time in this work.
Stratigraphic position
Biostratigraphic position
The Langbergia-Garjainia Subzone occurs above the
Lystrosaurus declivis Assemblage Zone and underlies the
Trirachodon-Kannemeyeria Subzone of the Cynognathus
Assemblage Zone.
Lithostratigraphic position
Occupies the lowermost part of the Burgersdorp Formation,
which is roughly 100 m in the thickest part of the section.
Derivation of name
The name is derived from the distinctive and fairly common
trirachodontid cynodont Langbergia modisei and the mediumsized erythrosuchid archosauriform Garjainia madiba, which
co-occur only in the rocks of this subzone (Figure 3).
Historical background
The interpretation advanced by du Toit (1918) and Van Eeden
(1937) on the lateral extent of the Burgersdorp Formation long
implied the presence of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone as
far north as the towns of Bethlehem and Kestell in the northern
Free State. Yet it was not until Welman et al. (1991) reported
fossils assignable to this biozone from the northeastern
and northwestern Free State Province that there was any
palaeontological evidence to corroborate the northward
extension of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone.
Hancox et al. (1995) and Shishkin et al. (1995) pointed out
that the fossil fauna recovered from the northern Free State
Province was dominated by the capitosauroid temnospondyl
Kestrosaurus, and utilised this genus as the basis for a lower
subdivision of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone. Neveling
(2002, 2004) and Neveling et al. (2005) demonstrated the

southern limit of this fauna could be extended as far as the towns
of Tarkastad and Queenstown. This new biozone was previously
referred to as the “lower zone”, “lowermost subzone” (Hancox
et al., 1995; Shishkin et al., 1995),”subzone A fauna” (Hancox
and Rubidge 1997; Hancox 1998), the “Kestrosaurus grouping”
(Shishkin 2000), the “Kestrosaurus Assemblage Zone” (Neveling
2002, 2004) and Cynognathus A biozone (Rubidge, 2005).
Palaeontology
Description of subzone
A concurrent range zone characterised by the presence of
the cynodonts Langbergia modisei and the erythrosuchid
archosauriform Garjainia madiba. To date no dicynodonts are
known from the subzone, making this the only stratigraphic
interval in the Beaufort Group lacking dicynodont fossils. No
fossil wood has been collected to date and the only direct
evidence of plant fossils is a single small sphenophyte cast
(Hancox, 1998).
Taphonomic notes on fossil occurrences
The overwhelming majority (>95%) of fossils assigned to this
subzone has been recovered from the north-western exposures
of the Burgersdorp Formation, between the towns of Senekal
and Bethlehem. Here vertebrate material has been collected
from dark reddish brown (10R 3/4) horizontally laminated to
massive, lacustrine mudstones and siltstones, light grey (5Y 7/1),
ﬁne to medium-grained channel sandstones and their associated
intraformational lag conglomerates, and in dark reddish-brown
(10R 3/4) overbank mudstones and siltstones, and intercalated
thin (>1 m) sandstones. The most common taphonomic mode
in the lower lacustrine mudstones and siltstones is as wellpreserved, complete, though totally disarticulated elements.
Isolated elements may also be recovered from channel
sandstones. A rich (in terms of both number and diversity)
microfauna has been collected from the intraformational lag
conglomerates, with almost all of the fossil material being
fragmentary. Bone elements tend to be incomplete, being
represented by the most robust bones such as mandibular
remains, isolated teeth, amphibian post glenoid areas, pterygoids
and tabulars, and various long bone heads, phalanges and
vertebrae. Coprolites are extremely abundant.
Bone is rare in the overbank deposits of the uppermost
Burgersdorp Formation of the distal sector, but includes
amphibian, archosauriform, procolophonid and cynodont
material. Most of the fossils from this sequence occur as
isolated, disarticulated specimens with thick haematitic coatings.
In places, cracks in the fossil material are ﬁlled with calcite.
A similar taphonomic signature is exhibited by fossil material
collected from the lowermost Burgersdorp Formation in the
southern Free State and Eastern Cape provinces.
List of fossils
See Figure 4 for ranges of the vertebrate genera.

Thickness
The Langbergia-Garjainia Subzone reaches a maximum
thickness of 100 m between Aliwal North and Thaba Nchu
(Rutherford, 2009, Rutherford et al., 2015), thinning northwards
to around 50 m in the Paul Roux area. The fossil record is
currently too sparse to establish the biozone thickness south of

In the fossiliferous exposures of the north-western Free State
the stratigraphic succession may be subdivided into a lower,
horizontally-laminated to massive, ﬁnes-dominated unit, a more
sandstone-rich middle sequence, and an upper, ﬁnes-dominated
sequence, which in places also preserves isolated thick lenticular
sandstones. The lower ﬁnes unit is between 10 to 20 m thick,
and is dominated by dark reddish brown (10R 3/4) mudstone
and siltstone, which is generally laminated to semi-massive in
nature and lacks pedogenic overprinting. At places lag horizons
of reworked ferromanganese glaebules occur, which often
contain multi-taxa bone assemblages. The middle sandstone
unit, up to 6 m thick, is dominated by light grey (5Y 7/1), ﬁnegrained sandstone, internally structured by trough and planar
cross-stratiﬁed and ripple laminated sandstones. The sandstone
unit may preserve bone bearing intraformational clast
conglomerates. The upper sequence comprises up to 40 m
of dark reddish-brown (10R 3/4) ﬁnes and intercalated thin

(>1 m) sandstones, which are more grayish brown (5YR 3/2)
towards the top of the sequence. Mudstone units show evidence
of colour mottling, as well as stacking of weakly developed
vertic structures, with ﬁne blue siltstone inﬁll. Apart from rare
occurrences of bone at the base of thin sandstones, the upper
mudstone dominated succession preserves only sporadic bones
(and coprolites) that usually have thick encrustations of
haematite and calcite.
In the south the lithology is dominated by massive greyish
red (5R 4/2, 10R 4/2) and pale reddish brown (10 5/4) ﬁnes with
subordinate greenish grey (5GY 6/1) and light grey (N7)
sandstone, arranged in upwards-ﬁning packages up to 7 m thick.
Calcareous nodules, desiccation features and bioturbation
characterise the thin and laterally constrained pedogenic
horizons. Stacked, ﬁne-grained sandstone sheets, commonly
occur near the top of this subzone in the south.
Towards the south, rocks of the Langbergia-Garjainia
biozone are conformably overlain by middle Burgersdorp
Formation strata, whereas in the north between Senekal and
Paul Roux they are unconformably overlain by the Indwe
Member of the Molteno Formation.

It also coincides with the ﬁrst occurrence of both Langbergia
modisei and Garjainia madiba.
Upper boundary
The upper boundary of the Langbergia-Garjainia Subzone is
deﬁned by the ﬁrst occurrence of the trirachodontid cynodont
Trirachodon berryi and the dicynodont genus Kannemeyeria
simocephalus.

Regional aspects
Geographic distribution

Depositional history
The lack of pedogenic modiﬁcation, the homogeneous nature
of the ﬁnes, and the abundance of well-preserved amphibian
and archosaur remains in the northern exposures suggests that
the rocks of the lowermost part of Langbergia-Garjainia
Subzone were deposited in extensive lacustrine systems
(Groenewald, 1989; Welman et al., 1991; Hancox, 1998). The
middle sandstone dominated unit represents both low energy
meandering channels and lacustrine deltas. Secondary rounding
of clay pebbles, coprolites and fossil bone in the bioclast lags
implies the reworking of earlier deposits, and the rounding of
ﬂoodplain material and the abrasion of skeletal material in
channel. The uppermost ﬁnes dominated succession exhibits
colour mottling and preserves numerous large rhizocretions,
root inﬁlls and desiccation cracks. These are thought to
represent fairly rapid overbank ﬂoodplain aggradation,
punctuated by periods of incipient soil development. Where
present, the sandstones in the upper sequence have a width to
depth ratio of 1:15 to 1:20, are lenticular in nature, and are
internally structured by horizontal and trough cross-stratiﬁcation.
Hancox (1998) proposed that this was deposited by a highsinuosity channel system with ﬂuctuating discharge based on
the lenticular nature and ﬁning-upward ﬁll of the channel
sandstones, characterised by ﬁne grained horizontal and trough
cross-stratiﬁcation. Neveling (2002, 2004) proposed a similar
ﬂuvial environment, subject to ephemeral ﬂow patterns, for the
outcrops of this subzone in the southern Free State and Eastern
Cape provinces.
Boundaries
Lower boundary

Spatially, the Langbergia-Garjainia Subzone extends from the
town of Queenstown in the south (Neveling 2002) to a line
between the towns of Senekal and Harrismith in the north
(Figure 2). The subzone has been traced as far east as Bergville.
To date its extent further south in KwaZulu-Natal is unknown.
The Langbergia-Garjainia Subzone is best exposed in the
Aliwal North, Thaba Nchu, Senekal and Paul Roux districts.
Lateral and vertical variation
As mentioned above, the overwhelming majority (>95%) of
fossils assigned to this subzone have been recovered between
the towns of Senekal and Bethlehem in the northwestern Free
State Province. Limited exposure may explain the decrease in
fossil discoveries further east to Bergville, but to the south a
clear and rapid decrease in fossil abundance is evident, with
a limited number of specimens recovered from exposures
near Rouxville, and numbers decreasing even more towards
Tarkastad. Even in the Senekal and Bethlehem localities,
complete fossil vertebrate specimens are not abundant, but are
fairly evenly distributed in the lower portion of the succession
where fossil amphibians predominate. Where developed in
the middle sandstone unit, fossil material is common in the
intraformational conglomerates. Fossils become scarcer in
the upper part of the northern succession.
Correlation
The fossil fauna from the Langbergia-Garjainia Subzone can be
correlated to the Parotosuchus Fauna of Russia via the cooccurrence of the erythrosuchid genus Garjainia and the
temnospondyl genus Parotosuchus.

The base of the Langbergia-Garjainia Subzone is deﬁned as the
ﬁrst appearance datum of the cynodont genus Cynognathus, the

Age
Based on correlation with ammonite-containing rocks from
the Cis-Caspian depression and western Kazakhstan, the
Parotosuchus Fauna is dated as Early Triassic (late Olenekian;
Shishkin et al., 2000). Based on the correlation proposed above
an Early Triassic age has been accepted by most authors for the
Langbergia-Garjainia Subzone (Hancox et al., 1995; Shishkin
et al., 1995; Hancox and Rubidge 1997; Hancox 1998; Shishkin
et al., 2000; Neveling, 2004; Shishkin et al., 2004; Rubidge, 2005;
Gower et al., 2014).
Type locality
Extensive donga exposures on the farm Driefontein 11 in the
Bethlehem District, Free State Province, is the stratotype locality
for the Langbergia-Garjainia Subzone (Figure 5).
Trirachodon-Kannemeyeria Subzone
Proposer of name
This subzone is ﬁrst proposed in this work.
Stratigraphic position
Biostratigraphic
The Trirachodon-Kannemeyeria Subzone occurs above the
Langbergia-Garjainia Subzone and underlies the CricodonUfudocyclops Subzone.

Palaeontology
Description of subzone
The Trirachodon-Kannemeyeria Subzone is characterised by the
occurrence of the cynodonts Trirachodon berryi, Cricodon
kannemeyerii, Cynognathus crateronotus and Diademodon
tetragonus, the dicynodont Kannemeyeria simocephalus, the
temnospondyl Xenotosuchus africanus (Morales. and Shishkin,
2002, Damiani, 2008) and to a lesser degree the erythrosuchid
Erythrosuchus africanus. Actinopterygian ﬁsh are abundant
near Rouxville, at the Bekkerskraal locality (Broom, 1909b,
Hutchinson, 1973, Jubb and Gardiner, 1975). Plant fossils are
rare but are known from two major localities in the vicinity of
Aliwal North and Burgersdorp (Anderson and Anderson, 1985).
Taphonomic notes on fossil occurrences
Complete articulated skeletons are rare. Disarticulated, but well
preserved, dispersed and isolated tetrapod fossils occur in
mudstone/siltstone overbank deposits, frequently associated
with calcareous concretions. Complete skulls of tetrapods also
occur in ﬁne-to medium-grained sandstone lenses. Fragmentary
non-mammalian synapsid and amphibian remains frequently
occur in localised “bone beds” within the mudstones, and
also in conglomerates at the base of lenticular sandstones
(Kitching, 1963).

Derivation of name
This subzone is named after the distinctive and fairly common
trirachodontid cynodont Trirachodon berryi and the distinctive
dicynodont Kannemeyeria simocephalus that co-occur only in
the strata deﬁned by this subzone (Figure 6).
Historical background
The Trirachodon-Kannemeyeria Subzone as described here
corresponds to the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone as described
in Kitching (1995), and to Seeley’s (1892) zone of specialised
theriodonts, Broom’s (1906a, 1909a) Cynognathus Beds, Kitching’s
(1970, 1977) Cynognathus Zone, the Kannemeyeria Assemblage
Zone of Keyser and Smith (1978), the KannemeyeriaDiademodon Assemblage Zone of Keyser (1979) and the
Cynognathus-Diademodon Assemblage Zone of Kitching (1984).
It would also correspond to what has previously been
referred to as the “middle subzone” (Hancox et al., 1995;
Shishkin et al., 1995), “subzone B fauna” (Hancox and Rubidge
1997; Hancox 1998), the “Xenotosuchus grouping” (Shishkin
2000), and the Cynognathus B biozone (Rubidge, 2005).

Geological description
Thickness
The thickness of the Trirachodon-Kannemeyeria Subzone varies
from 500 m in the south between Queenstown and Lady Frere,
to around 150 m between Burgersdorp and Aliwal North, and
around 70 m in the vicinity of Thaba ‘Nchu (Rutherford 2009,
Rutherford et. al., 2015).
Lithology

cycles of arenitic sandstone, overlain by thick sequences
of ﬁnes. The sandstones of the Burgersdorp Formation are
predominantly ﬁne to medium grained and yellowish grey
(5Y 7/2), light brownish grey (5Y 6/1), greenish grey (5GR 6/1),
light olive grey (5Y 6/1) or greyish red purple (5RP 4/2) in
colour. They tend to weather to dusky yellow (5Y 6/4), olive
grey (5Y 3/2) or very dusky purple (5P 4/2). Fragmentary
reptilian and amphibian fossil remains, as well as casts and
imprints of fossil plant stems and leaves are, in many places,
preserved in the sandstones. The ﬁner fraction consists
predominantly of greyish red (5R 4/2 to 10R 4/2) and greyish
red purple mudstones (5RP 4/2), light bluish grey (5B 7/1),
greenish grey (5G 6/1) and light olive grey (5Y 5/2) siltstones,
and light bluish grey (5B 7/1) ﬁne to very ﬁne-grained
sandstones. Well preserved, though non-abundant, remains
of fossil reptiles and amphibians, as well as coprolites,
rhizocretions, root casts and siliciﬁed wood are preserved in the
ﬁner grained rocks. Brown-weathering calcareous concretions
encasing complete vertebrate skeletons are present within
sandstones towards the middle part of the succession. Claypebble conglomerates containing fossilised bone are not
uncommon in the biozone. Fines to sandstone ratios of ± 4:1,
and channel width to depth ratios of between 18 to 20 are
common. The channel complex deposits are internally composed
of channel and point bar elements, and characteristically display a
classic ﬁning upward sequence.
Depositional history
The sedimentary strata of the Burgersdorp Formation that
preserve a Trirachodon-Kannemeyeria Subzone fauna were
previously interpreted as being deposited by meandering, high
sinuosity rivers, with ﬁne grained sediment accumulating in an
inland basin, receiving detritus from the south, southwest and
southeast (Hiller and Stavrakis, 1984; Johnson and Hiller, 1990;
Kitching, 1995; Groenewald, 1996; Hancox, 1998, Bordy and
Krummeck, 2016, Bordy et al., 2019). The recognition of: thick
and thin, lenticular, bedload and mixed-load dominated channel
ﬁll elements; low angle lateral accretion surfaces; point bars with
interspersed mudstone couplets; a high suspended load/bedload
ratio; and the presence of thick suspended load ﬂoodplain
deposits with interspersed sandstone splays led Hancox (1998)
to propose a mixed load, high sinuosity meandering ﬂuvial
system with frequent periods of overbank ﬂooding and levee
breach. The high variance and low vector strengths of the
palaeocurrent data is further evidence for deposition by a high
sinuosity meandering system rather than a low sinuosity system
(Hancox, 1998; Bordy et al., 2019).
Boundaries
Lower boundary
The base of the Trirachodon-Kannemeyeria Subzone is deﬁned

Burgersdorp Formation are characterised by ﬁning upward

Subdivisions
No subdivision of the Trirachodon-Kannemeyeria Subzone is
proposed.
Regional aspects
Geographic distribution
Rocks containing a Trirachodon-Kannemeyeria fauna equate to
the middle part of the Burgersdorp Formation (Hancox 1998;
Neveling 2002) and outcrop from Cala and Queenstown in the
south as far as Thaba ‘Nchu in the north (Figure 2). From the
Lady Frere and Queenstown districts the biozone has been
traced as far east as the Encgcobo district. In Kwazulu-Natal the
biozone becomes progressively narrower as it thins in a
northeasterly direction. In the far south of the basin these rocks
are disconformably overlain by strata of the upper Burgersdorp

Formation whereas, progressing north of the town of
Molteno, rocks containing a Trirachodon-Kannemeyeria fauna
are disconformably overlain ﬁrst by the Bamboesberg Member
of the Molteno Formation, and north of Zastron, by the Indwe
Member of the Molteno Formation.
Lateral and vertical variation
Complete specimens are not abundant but are fairly evenly
distributed in the lower portion of the succession. They become
scarcer in the upper part of the succession as well as showing
a decrease in the variety of fossil forms, with fossil amphibian
remains being relatively common. Paleontologically there is also
a change towards a greater amount of preserved plant material,
and an increase in the number of recovered specimens of
Kannemeyeria in the upper part of the subzone (Hancox, 1998).

Correlation

Age

The Trirachodon-Kannemeyeria Subzone may be correlated
to the Lower Omingonde Formation of Namibia (Keyser, 1973),
the lower horizon of the Ntawere Formation of Zambia
(Cruickshank 1965, 1986, Peecook et al., 2013, 2018, Wynd et al.,
2018) the uppermost Kingori/lower Lifua members of Tanzania
(Cruickshank 1965, 1986, Smith et al., 2018), the upper member
of the Fremouw Formation of Antarctica (Sidor et al., 2008), the
Lower Ermaying Formation of China (Li and Cheng, 1995) and
the Eryosuchus Fauna of Russia.
South America, and particularly Argentina and southernmost
Brazil, has an extensive record of non-marine Triassic
sedimentary successions. Faunal links between terrestrial Triassic
assemblages from South America and South Africa are however
rare (Abdala and Smith 2009), and until recently were based
only on the common presence of the cynodonts Cynognathus
crateronotus (Bonaparte 1969, 1982; Abdala 1996) and
Diademodon tetragonus (Martinelli et al., 2009) from the Río
Seco de la Quebrada Formation (Stipanicic et al., 2007) of the
Puesto Viejo Group of Argentina.

No radiometric dates exist for the Trirachodon-Kannemeyeria
Subzone strata and the ages are derived directly from correlation
of fossil faunas with better-dated Gondwanan successions in
Africa, South America and north China. Various age estimates
have been given, but in general they are assigned a Middle
Triassic (early Anisian) age (Keyser, 1973; Grine et al., 1979;
Hammer, 1990; Hancox, 1998, 2000; Rubidge, 2005; Butler et al.,
2015; Liu et al., 2017; but see also Ottone et al., 2014).
Type locality
The South African Committee for Stratigraphy (SACS, 1980)
designated the Nonensis Nek area on the main road between
Queenstown and Lady Frere as the stratotype locality for the
Kannemeyeria-Diademodon Assemblage Zone and this is
retained here for the Trirachodon-Kannemeyeria Subzone
(Figure 8).

Historical background
The biozone was discovered by Graeme Morgan in the mid1990s, with most of the descriptive work being that of Hancox
(1998). Additional palaeontological descriptions are provided in
Damiani and Hancox (2003), Abdala et al. (2005), Hancox et al.
(2013) and Kammerer et al. (2019).
The Cricodon-Ufudocyclops Subzone corresponds to what
has previously been referred to as the upper zone and
uppermost faunal assemblage (Hancox et al., 1995), the
“uppermost subzone” (Shishkin et al., 1995; Hancox and
Rubidge 1996), subzone C (Hancox and Rubidge 1997; Hancox
et al., 2000), the upper Cynognathus grouping (Shishkin et al.,
2000), the Cynognathus C Biozone (Rubidge, 2005) and the
Cricodon subdivision (Rubidge et al., 2016).
Palaeontology
Description of subzone
The Cricodon-Ufudocyclops Subzone is characterised by a
dominance of cynodont fossils, particularly the index taxon
Cricodon metabolus. It is a concurrent range zone characterised
by the presence of Cricodon metabolus and the dicynodont
Ufudocyclops mukanelai.
Taphonomic notes on fossil occurrences
Articulated skeletons are very rare. Disarticulated, but well
preserved, dispersed and isolated tetrapod fossils occur in
laminated mudstone/siltstone units. Complete skulls of tetrapods
also occur in ﬁne-to-medium grained sandstones and this mode
of preservation is by far the most common in the subzone.
Fragmentary therapsid and temnospondyl amphibian remains
also occur in localised palaeosol horizons. No archosauriformes
or ﬁsh are yet known from the subzone.

Geological description
Thickness
The biozone reaches a maximum thickness of 150 m in the
Sterkstroom area of the Eastern Cape (Hancox, 1998).
Lithology
For the most part the strata of the upper part of the Burgersdorp
Formation are characterised by ﬁning upward cycles of
sandstone, overlain by thick sequences of ﬁnes. The upper
part of the Burgersdorp Formation has a higher percentage
of sandstone than either the middle or lower sections, and
the channel geometries are signiﬁcantly deeper than in the
underlying middle Burgersdorp Formation. The sandstone
bodies also lack interspersed mudstone couplets within the
point bar elements (Hancox, 1998). The sandstones of the upper
Burgersdorp Formation are predominantly ﬁne to medium
grained and yellowish grey (5Y 7/2), light brownish grey
(5Y 6/1), greenish grey (5GR 6/1), light olive grey (5Y 6/1) or
greyish red purple (5RP 4/2) in colour. They tend to weather to
dusky yellow (5Y 6/4), olive grey (5Y 3/2) or very dusky purple
(5P 4/2). They are internally structured predominantly by
horizontal and large scale trough cross-stratiﬁcation.
Fragmentary and complete reptilian and amphibian fossil
remains, as well as casts and imprints of fossil plant stems and
leaves, are in many places preserved in the sandstones. The ﬁner
fraction consists predominantly of greyish red (5R 4/2 to
10R 4/2) and greyish red purple mudstones (5RP 4/2), light
bluish grey (5B 7/1), greenish grey (5G 6/1) and light olive grey
(5Y 5/2) siltstones, and light bluish grey (5B 7/1) ﬁne to very
ﬁne-grained sandstones. Complete fossil tetrapod material may
be preserved in places in the overbank ﬁnes, which in places
are also pedogenically modiﬁed.

The gross ﬁning upward sequence, sand body geometry,
internal architecture (including point bar elements without
mudstone drapes) and facies relationships of the channel
sandstones in the upper Burgersdorp Formation resemble the
classic high sinuosity, meandering stream model (Hancox, 1998).
The abundance of upper ﬂow regime horizontal stratiﬁcation
and large scale trough cross-stratiﬁcation, with large mudstone
intraclasts and high cut-banks are evidence for formation of the
deposits in a mixed load large sized meandering river system
with considerable bank relief and channel depth. The presence
of abundant bank stabilising vegetation is directly evidenced by
impressions of large fossil pteridosperm axes, casts of the
sphenophyte Calamites and siliciﬁed wood (Hancox, 1998).

Ufudocyclops Subzone is restricted to this strip in the
Bamboesberg Mountains of the Eastern Cape.

The base of the Cricodon-Ufudocyclops Subzone is deﬁned as
the ﬁrst appearance of Cricodon metabolus and Ufudocylops

Lateral and vertical variation

Upper boundary
The top of this subzone is undeﬁned biostratigraphically
because vertebrate fossils are lacking in the overlying
Bamboesberg Member of the Molteno Formation.
Lateral boundaries
The Cricodon-Ufudocyclops Subzone occurs only in the southern
part of the basin and is thickest in the Sterkstroom area. It thins
northward and is overlain by the Bamboesberg Member of the
Molteno Formation.
Subdivisions
No subdivision of the Cricodon-Ufudocyclops Subzone is proposed.
Regional aspects
Geographic distribution
Sedimentary rocks assigned to this subzone are best exposed in
the Sterkstroom to Molteno districts and spatially, the Cricodon-

Complete specimens are not abundant but are fairly evenly
distributed in the succession. Cynodonts dominate the fauna.
Fossils become scarcer in the upper part of the succession
towards the contact with the Molteno Formation (Hancox, 1998).
Correlation
The fossil fauna of the Cricodon-Ufudocyclops Subzone may be
correlated to parts of the upper Omingonde Formation of
Namibia (Keyser 1973), the upper horizon of the Ntawere
Formation of northeastern Zambia (Sidor and Hopson, 2018)
and the Lifua beds of Tanzania (Wynd et al., 2018). The
occurrence of Paracylotosaurus would allow for a genus level
link to the Yerrapalli Formation of India (Damiani and Hancox,
2003), Wiannamatta Group of Australia (Watson 1958), and the
occurrence of Shansiodon to the Upper Ermaying Formation
(Sinokannemeyeria Fauna) of China (Li and Chen, 1995,
Hancox, 1998, Hancox et al., 2013).

No radiometric dates exist for the Cricodon-Ufudocyclops
Subzone and the age arguments are derived directly from faunal
correlation of the subzone. Based on these correlations the

Figure 11. Map showing the Type locality of the Cricodon-Ufudocyclops Subzone.

Cricodon-Ufudocyclops Subzone may be considered as Middle
Triassic (late Anisian or early Ladinian). Liu et al. (2017) have
recently published a high resolution chemical abrasion–thermal
ionization mass spectrometry (CA-TIMS) date of 243.53 Ma (late
Anisian) for a volcanic ash interbedded with vertebrate fossils
from the Ermaying Formation (Sinokannemeyeria Fauna) of
China. The co-occurrence of Shansiodon in these two faunas
may suggest that the Cricodon-Ufudocyclops Subzone is of a
similar age. It should hover be noted that Ottone et al. (2014)
obtained a SHRIMP 238U/206Pb age of 235.8 ± 2.0 Ma, for a
rhyolitic ignimbrite interdigitated between the Quebrada de los

234

Fósiles and Río Seco de la Quebrada formations (Puesto
Viejo Group) in Argentina, which contains Cynognathus and
Diademodon, and hence the uppermost parts of the CricodonUfudocyclops Subzone may even reach into the Carnian
(Late Triassic).
Type locality
We here designate exposures on the farm Avilion in the
Sterkstroom District as the stratotype locality for the CricodonUfudocyclops Subzone (Figure 11).

Acknowledgements
The senior author would like to record the important mentoring
role of Professor James Kitching in igniting the spark of passion
for the geology and palaeontology of the Cynognathus
Assemblage Zone. The late Graeme Morgan is speciﬁcally
acknowledged for the original discovery of the fossil fauna of
the Cricodon-Ufudocylops Subzone.We would also like to thank
all the farmers who allowed access to their lands, for
their permissions, and for the hospitality shown. Numerous
colleagues who have helped collect in the biozone, particularly
at the Driefontein site. You are too numerous to name individually,
but we would like to thank you all collectively. Dr Eva
Schneiderhan is thanked for her help collecting in the ﬁeld and
for her creation of the original type locality maps. We would
like to acknowledge The African Origins platform of the National
Research Foundation of South Africa (NRF), the Palaeontological
Scientiﬁc Trust (PAST), and the DSI/NRF Centre of Excellence for
Palaeosciences for ﬁnancial assistance. This work also beneﬁtted
greatly from a critical review by Professor Chris Sidor.

A signiﬁcant number (more than 100) of brown to dark and silty, carbonate or pyrite-mineralized, in part organic
carbon-rich, spherical or oval-shaped structures have been collected from the Upper Triassic (uppermost Norianlower Rhaetian) sediments of the Lipie Śląskie clay-pit at Lisowice near Lubliniec town, Poland. Their geological
context, morphology, content, geochemistry and association with skeletal remains suggest they are fecal masses
of a sizable herbivorous tetrapod. The only large herbivore known from the site is a giant 5 meter-long dicynodont (Synapsida: Anomodontia), represented by numerous bones and also by large, oval-shaped footprints.
The putative dicynodont coprolites were collected from mudstone and siltstone with numerous organic remains
that were deposited in anoxic conditions. In addition, REEs and other trace element concentrations suggest that
the burial environment and diagenesis of these coprolites were under anoxic conditions. SEM and thin section
images of the coprolite matrix show numerous nests with pyrite (probably bacterial in origin) and large amount
of mineral particles. The putative dicynodont coprolites contain also amorphous, dark organic matter, poorly preserved palynomorphs, small fragments of plant cuticle. Detailed characteristic of these coprolites reveals possible
implications for the ecology and physiology of the source animal species. The δ 13C values of the gymnosperm cuticle and dark organic matter measured in three coprolites are −23.4‰, −21.2‰ and −20.3‰, all average. The
evidence from these coprolites suggests that dicynodonts processed plant soft elements into very small pieces,
but wood fragments were found also in a mass accumulation in two coprolites.

1. Introduction
Fossil feces, formally known as coprolites, may reveal interesting
and unique data about the diet of extinct animals (Chin and Kirkland,
1998; Dutta and Ambwani, 2007; Smith and Botha-Brink, 2011; Owocki
et al., 2012), the food web in ancient ecosystems (Chin and Gill, 1996;
Chin, 2007; Chin et al., 2009), behavior (Fiorelli et al., 2013;
Niedźwiedzki, in press) and physiology of the source animals (Chin
et al., 2003). However, relatively small numbers of coprolites from herbivorous tetrapods older than Pliocene in age have been described and
their signiﬁcance for the source animals' ecology well discussed.
Coprolites of plant eating tetrapods from the Mesozoic and Permian
deposits are of great importance, since several lineages of herbivorous
tetrapods appeared at that time. Coprolites of these animals can be a
source of valuable data about their biology and the origin of adaptations
to herbivore physiology.

The best known Mesozoic coprolites of herbivores include Upper
Jurassic herbivorous dinosaur coprolites from the Morrison Formation
(Chin and Kirkland, 1998), Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) hadrosaur
Maiasaura peeblesorum coprolites from the Two Medicine Formation,
Montana (Chin and Gill, 1996; Chin, 2007; Chin et al., 2009), and
Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) herbivorous dinosaur coprolites
from the Lameta Formation, India (Ghosh et al., 2003; Kar et al., 2004;
Ambwani and Dutta, 2005; Prasad et al., 2005; Dutta and Ambwani,
2007). Recently, several massive coprolite associations were reported
from the Middle–Upper Triassic of the Chañares Formation, Argentina,
which appear to represent fossil communal latrines of kannemeyeriiform
dicynodonts (Fiorelli et al., 2013).
Here we report on a new occurrence of putative dicynodont coprolite accumulations which were discovered in the Upper Triassic strata
in the Lipie Śląskie clay-pit at Lisowice, Upper Silesia (Fig. 1). The fecal
nature of these specimens was originally suggested by the sedimentological context, comminuted plant contents, and associated tetrapod
fossils. We provide the ﬁrst description of such fossils with food residues
collected in the Keuper deposits of Germanic Basin. Their morphology,
content, similarity to other described dicynodont coprolites (Hunt
et al., 1998; Souto, 2001; Fiorelli et al., 2013; Hunt et al., 2013) and association with the skeletal remains of large dicynodonts suggest that they
are fecal masses of this large herbivorous therapsid (Fig. 2). In the same

layers numerous phosphatic coprolites (containing dicynodont bone
fragments) of a large carnivore were also found (Niedźwiedzki, in
press). Therefore, new specimens described in this paper offer a new
view on the characteristics of dicynodont feces as well as possibly on
some aspects of the dicynodont ecology and physiology. We also
describe the geological and sedimentological characteristics of the putative dicynodont coprolite accumulations from the Lipie Śląskie clay-pit,
which may be comparable to communal latrine-bearing areas described
from other Triassic sites (Fiorelli et al., 2013).
Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in coprolites provide unique
trophic perspectives on ancient ecosystems (Ghosh et al., 2003; Prasad

Lisowice.

et al., 2005) as they represent residues from the digestive tract of the extinct tetrapod. According to Vogel (1978) and Lee-Thorp et al. (1989)
the stable isotope ratio of organic carbon in excrements represents the
average composition of food sources. Stable isotopes of carbon and
nitrogen (δ13C and δ15N, respectively) are powerful tools for tracing nutrient ﬂow within ancient ecosystems (Schweizer et al., 2006). Two
factors such as preservation and microbial processes sometimes change
C/N ratios in organisms (DeNiro, 1985), stable isotopic compositions
of C and N components tend to be preserved in fossilized remains
(Masters, 1987).
Usually, it is very hard or impossible to link fossil dung with its producer species (Chin, 1997; Owocki et al., 2012; Bajdek, 2013). Some rare
exceptions of very likely source-species-assigned coprolites from the
tetrapod Mesozoic record include the Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian)
theropod Tyrannosaurus rex coprolite from the Frenchman Formation,
Canada (Chin et al., 1998), another theropod Allosaurus fragilis coprolite
from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation, USA (Stone et al., 2000),
previously mentioned hadrosaur Maiasaura peeblesorum coprolites
and predatory archosaur Smok wawelski coprolites (Niedźwiedzki, in
press) from the Upper Triassic of Poland.
Possible dicynodont coprolites previously have been assigned to the
ichnotaxon Dicynodontocopros maximus by Hunt et al. (1998), who also
summarized the history of their examination in review papers on vertebrate coprolites (2007, 2013). However, D. maximus coprolites are phosphatic in composition (anonymous journal reviewer, 2014). According
to Hunt et al. (2007) possible dicynodont coprolites were initially described by Case (1922) from the Upper Triassic Tecovas Formation,

P. Bajdek et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 411 (2014) 1–17

Texas. They were 5–18 cm long, smooth surfaced and lacking vertebrate
bone inclusions. The holotype of D. maximus UMMP 7255, stored in the
Museum of Paleontology, University of Michigan, is based on one of
those specimens. Large, amorphous forms up to 12 cm in length and
nearly 6 cm in width were also described by Rusconi (1949) from the
Middle Triassic of Argentina. Ochev (1974) described Middle Triassic
coprolites including 2–10 cm long specimens with possible plant impressions from localities in Russia (Karagachka, Donguz I and Bukobay V) and
Kazakhstan (Mollo-Khara-Bala-Kantemir) and compared them with
those described by Case (1922). Hunt (1992) and Hunt et al. (1998)
discussed the occurrence of D. maximus in the Upper Triassic (Carnian)
of the Chinle Group, including the Bluewater Creek Formation of Arizona.
Souto (2001) described ovoid and cylindrical coprolite morphotypes
from the Middle Triassic Santa Maria Formation, Brazil, suggesting that
the ovoid forms might have been produced by dicynodonts. Northwood
(2005) described a possible coprolite of a herbivore from the Lower Triassic Arcadia Formation, Australia. The source animal may have been a dicynodont, however Northwood noticed that this blocky, elongate
specimen was morphologically different from coprolites previously
assigned to dicynodonts. Recently, Fiorelli et al. (2013) reported the
ﬁrst non-mammal megaherbivore communal latrines from eight massive
coprolite accumulations in the Middle–Upper Triassic of northwestern
Argentina. Defecation of dicynodonts in so-called communal latrines reveals that this gregarious behavior is not unique to mammals. In the
newest review paper on Triassic vertebrate coprolites (Hunt et al.,
2013) a new ichnogenus of dicynodont coprolite (Santamariacopros
elongatus) was introduced, based on one of the coprolite morphotypes
described by Souto (2001) from the Santa Maria Formation.
2. Geological setting
The Lipie Śląskie clay-pit at Lisowice (Fig. 1) displays an approximately 12 m thick stratigraphical section composed of gray and greenish to reddish ﬂuvial mudstone, siltstone interbedded with cross- or
horizontally-stratiﬁed sandstone. The strata exposed in the Lipie Śląskie
clay-pit correspond to the uppermost part of the Middle and lower part
of the Upper Keuper deposits of the Germanic Basin (Aigner and
Bachmann, 1992; Szulc et al., 2006; Franz et al., 2007a,b; Dzik et al.,
2008a,b; Franz, 2008).
The material described in this paper was collected from the bonebearing interval of gray mudstone and siltstone interpreted as a low
energy ﬂuvial environment (Dzik et al., 2008a,b). The dark color of the
mudstone, which is rich in well-preserved plant fossils and high pyrite
content, suggests anoxic conditions during the formation of the
coprolite-bearing deposit. The age of the deposit of the Lipie Śląskie
clay-pit is interpreted as the latest Norian-early Rhaetian, based on
paleobotanical data as well as on conchostracans and tetrapods (Dzik
et al., 2008a,b; Niedźwiedzki et al., 2012; Świło et al., in press).

fragments of typical late Norian-Rhaetian seed-fern Lepidopteris
(Staneczko, 2007). Other plant fossils include representatives of
Cycadophyta, Coniferophyta and Pteridospermophyta (Wawrzyniak and
Ziaja, 2009; Wawrzyniak, 2010a,b, 2011). Wawrzyniak (2010b) described
from this site such as cf. Nilsonia sp., cf. Androstrobus sp., and cf. Beania
sp. Other, but rather rare fossils are remains of cf. Elatocladus sp., a representative of the Coniferales. In the opinion of Wawrzyniak (2010b)
these species are characteristic elements of Early–Mid Jurassic ﬂoras.
Probable isoëtalean macrospores include Trileites cf. pinguis and
Horstisporites bertelseni (Fuglewicz, 1977) and in some, organic-rich
layers form mass accumulations. The most abundant pollen type is
wingless pollen Enzonalasporites sp. div., which co-occurs with abundant pollen of Corollina meyeriana and Granuloperculatipollis rudis
(Staneczko, 2007; Dzik et al., 2008a,b).
Among invertebrate fossils there are common freshwater bivalves
Tihkia silesiaca (Skawina and Dzik, 2011), but the most common are
ostracods (Darwinula sp. and Rhombocythere sp.) which occur only in
few horizons in the lower part of the gray-unit and can form massive
accumulations if present.
The conchostracans Gregoriusella polonica and Euestheria sp. are
small (1.5–3.5 mm in length), being morphologically close to Euestheria
brodieana from the Rhaetian of England and the United States (Kozur
and Weems, 2005, 2007, 2010). Numerous carapaces of much larger
species Shipingia sp. (3–6 mm in length) were also collected in the lowermost part of the gray-unit.
Vertebrates are represented by hybodont sharks (genera Polyacrodus
and Hybodus) and dipnoan and actinopterygian ﬁshes as well as numerous tetrapods (Dzik et al., 2008a,b; Świło, 2010a,b,c; Świło and
Kowalski, 2011;Niedźwiedzki et al., 2012; Niedźwiedzki, in press;
Świło et al., in press). Bone remains of temnospondyls are represented
by a plagiosaurid and a large cyclotosaur. Reptile bone material includes
remains of small dinosauriforms, dinosaurs, poposaurids, pterosaur wing
bones and teeth, and a mammaliaform tooth (Świło et al., in press). The
cranial–postcranial elements of small archosauromorphs and diapsids
are known from the site (Niedźwiedzki, in press). A large 5–6 meterlong predatory dinosaur Smok wawelski Niedźwiedzki, Sulej et Dzik,
2012 is being intensively studied (Dzik et al., 2008a,b; Niedźwiedzki et
al., 2012; Niedźwiedzki, in press). The only large herbivorous tetrapod
known from the site is a giant 5 meter-long dicynodont (Fig. 2), which
is the largest dicynodont described to date (Dzik et al., 2008a,b;
Niedźwiedzki et al., 2011). Bite traces on dicynodont bones and possible
predator–prey interactions of Smok wawelski and this dicynodont
were described and discussed by Niedźwiedzki et al. (2011) as well.
Varied types of tetrapod footprints (including dicynodont large
and oval-shaped footprints) are also known from the site (Dzik et al.,
2008a,b; Niedźwiedzki, in press).

4. Material and methods
3. Paleobiological context
Lipie Śląskie clay-pit is rich in body and trace fossils. Plant cuticles,
larger plant fragments, spores and pollen tend to be well-preserved in
the gray mudstone–siltstone layers and also inside of inorganic in origin
calcareous nodules and septarian concretions. Charred trunks are also
common in these sediments and were likely transported by stream
water from drier areas. The dominant plant species at this site is a conifer
similar to species of genera Brachyphyllum, Pagiophyllum or Hirmeriella, as
is the case for other Norian, Rhaetian, and Jurassic fossil plant assemblages of the region (Clement-Westerhof and Van Konijnenburg-Van
Cittert, 1991). Its pollen of Corollina morphology is also very common in
palynomorph samples from the site. The second most common plant species is represented by branched twigs similar to Stachyotaxus from the
Rhaetian of Greenland and Scania, Sweden (Arndt, 2002). Ginkgoales
are represented by leaves similar to the genera Schmeissneria and pollen
similar to Monosulcites. Ferns are represented by abundant cuticle

All studied specimens were found in organic-rich, gray mudstone
and siltstone exposed in the middle and upper part of the section
(Fig. 1). Sixteen putative dicynodont coprolite specimens (ZPAL
V.33/1101-1116) are housed in the collection of the Institute of Paleobiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland (Figs. 3 and 4;
Table 1).
Most of the collected specimens are fragmented and incomplete;
some specimens have been partially reconstructed by ﬁtting broken
pieces together (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the measurement of the volume
as suggested by some researchers (Thulborn, 1991; Chin, 2002) was
not possible. Instead their total length and width were measured and
the general external morphology was described (Table 1). The seven
specimens subjected to destructive analysis were ﬁrst photographed
and measured. Four thin sections from partially preserved and organicrich specimens were made for study of internal structures and possible
food remains.

4.1. Microscope and SEM observations

4.2. REEs analysis

Standard polished thin sections of matrix from two coprolites were
examined petrographically using a compound light microscope (Leica
DM5500B at the Uppsala University), in normal and polarized light
with an attached Leica microsystem camera (Figs. 7, 8). The coprolite
matrices and surfaces were subjected to binocular microscope observations (Nikon Eclipse LV 100 POL at the University of Warsaw) and freshly broken surfaces were imaged and analyzed with a scanning electron
microscope (SEM) equipped with an EDS detector at the University of
Uppsala (Figs. 7, 8, 9).

Rare earth elements (REEs) and other trace elements were analyzed
using an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (Acme Analytical Laboratories Ltd., Vancouver, Canada). The 4 samples from 2 specimens were pulverized by ceramic box (Table 2). The 4-acid digestion on
0.25 g split was made on the obtained mesh. The splits were heated in
HNO3–HClO4–HF to fuming and taken to dryness. The residues were
dissolved in HCl. Solutions were analyzed by ICP-MS. The detection
limits were between 0.02 and 0.1 ppm varying for different trace elements. The Rare Earth Elements (REE) data were normalized (indicated

McLennan, 1985) to remove abundance effect.
4.3. TOC analysis
Concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC) were determined using
a Leco Carbon Analyzer CR-12 (Uppsala University, Sweden). For determination of TOC, carbonates from the coprolite and rock samples were
removed by treatment with 20% HCl and subsequent rinsing. Eight samples were analyzed (Table 3), six of them were taken from coprolites
and another two from fossilized wood and host sediment.
4.4. Stable carbon and nitrogen analysis
The stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of organic carbon in
the coprolites was performed using stable-isotope-ratio mass spectrometry and procedure presented by Schweizer et al. (2006). Three
coprolite samples were analyzed for their stable carbon and nitrogen
isotopic compositions (Table 4). Soft organic material was scraped
from the broken surface of the coprolites as a ﬁne powder; a small
amount (up to 15–20 mg) of macroscopically representative organic
material was loosened with clear needles under a binocular microscope
and placed in aluminum-foil bags with tweezers. All samples were
refrigerated to minimize alteration and microbial contamination of the
organic-rich material. Samples were combusted with ultra pure oxygen
at 1000 °C. The resulting gases (CO2 and N2) were separated. Isotope ratios of the combustion gases were analyzed using continuous ﬂow,
stable-isotope-ratio mass spectrometry, Finnigan MAT, DeltaplusXL
(Uppsala University, Sweden).
4.5. Analysis of HCl-resistant minerals
Six samples from three distinct coprolites (with a large amount of pyrite, organic matter and visible plant remains) were dissolved with 5% HCl
acid and the undissolved fraction was examined. The samples weighed
about 100 g (see Table 5) and were taken from the central part of the coprolites. Material after dissolution was sieved with a 2 mm mesh. The insoluble deposit was then dried and weighed. The results of the analysis of the
undissolved fraction are summarized in Table 5.
5. Coprolites description and content
5.1. General shape
Numerous (about 100 specimens) more or less irregular, spherical
or oval-shaped coprolites (range from 3 to 17 cm in diameter) were
collected or observed in the ﬁeld and sixteen of the most complete

specimens were measured (Figs. 4 and 5) and are housed in the collection. The original sizes of the largest individual coprolites are difﬁcult to
determine. Coprolite morphology is variable; some of them have original, not eroded surfaces and clear cut edges. All specimens are distinctly
different (are ovoid to spheroidal in shape, usually dark gray and organic
rich) from the mudstone and siltstone deposits and also bones, phosphatic coprolites of predatory tetrapods, oncoids, inorganic carbonate nodules
and septarian concretions or plant remains from the same site. These coprolites vary from grayish-brown to dark gray. All sampled coprolites lack
bone remains and other animal macrofossils (Figs. 6 and 7). Most of the
collected coprolites comprise small mineral particles, mainly quartz
grains and inorganic clasts (Fig. 8A, C, D). Coprolites are in places highly
mineralized by pyrite (Fig. 8B, E, F), but the main diagenetic alteration
is represented by calcite microspary replacement. Two analyzed coprolites contain highly fragmented and macroscopically visible plant material (Fig. 6A, B). The HCl-resistant minerals and particles (including
authigenic mineralization of pyrite) and organic carbon of one of the
studied carbonate-rich coprolites comprise about 30–50% of the mass
of the coprolites (Table 5). The vast majority of clasts are represented
by very small quartz grains (between 0.5 and 0.05 mm based on SEM
observations; Figs. 8, 9) and also very large grains of sand-sized particles
which are not quartz grains or pyrite crystals. A few specimens contain
visible but rare plant tissues (cuticle fragments and wood fragments),
palynomorphs (pollen and spores) and other accumulations of amorphous and dark organic carbon (Fig. 7A–D). Two types of organic carbon
remains (cuticle fragments and amorphous and dark organic matter)
were examined to characterize the carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition of residue and to identify the diet of the coprolite producers.
All the investigated samples are phosphate-free and contain a large
amount of authigenic sulﬁde minerals (mainly pyrite), sometimes in
the form of characteristic crystal nests (Figs. 6C and 8B), sphere-like objects or are disposed concentrically. In a few coprolites mineral particles
are concentrated in the form of small spherical structures (secondary
grains; Fig. 8D) and some pyrite minerals moreover show pseudomorphs after microbials, probably coccoid bacteria (Fig. 7E, F).
5.2. Plant cuticle fragments
Plant cuticle was found in two of the examined coprolites (Fig. 7B).
It is probably of a gymnosperm and resembles the cuticle of the
Cheirolapidecae (Clement-Westerhof and Van Konijnenburg-Van
Cittert, 1991). Plant cuticle can be resistant to decomposition and these
are probably remains of undigested plant fragments. At the Lisowice
site, several kinds of plant cuticles were described (Wawrzyniak,
2010a,b,c). Preliminary analysis of cuticle fragments recognized in the
coprolites suggests that only one type of cuticle appears to be present
in the coprolite material.

5.3. Palynomorphs
Palynomorphs were found in one of the analyzed samples of the
coprolites (Fig. 7A). Recognized palynotaxa include Corollina meyeriana,
Corollina sp., Monosulcites minimus and Porcellispora sp. They could
have been ingested by the feces producer with forage (host plant), or
digested accidentally, e.g. with drinking water. If they represent the
consumed plant species, the diet of this dicynodont species included
gymnosperm plants. Remains of fungi were not detected in the material.
5.4. Amorphous and dark organic matter
A great part of the dark matter in two analyzed coprolites is an
amorphous organic matter (Figs. 7D, 9B, C). This may represent residues
of well-digested plant tissues. No remains of wood, plant ﬁber or cuticle
were found and hence, it might be a carbon residue of a strongly
disintegrated plant tissue.
5.5. Concentrations of plant remains
In two specimens a signiﬁcant content of plant remains has been preserved. They compose about 40% of the coprolite volume (Fig. 6A, B).
These are mainly wood fragments; which are highly carbonized in
the present-day state of preservation. They are mostly elongate and
do not exceed 2 cm in length in the max dimension. These are residues
of highly-ﬁbrous woody elements of gymnosperm plants. Some of them
are broken, worn or sharp-edged.
5.6. Other observations
A few of the thin sections of the sampled coprolites revealed that the
coprolites are massive and rather structureless. Some of the specimens
possess internal small cavities that are probably an effect of microbial
processes (Fig. 8C). The coprolites have also considerable diagenetic alteration represented by pyrite, gypsum and calcite veins (Figs. 6D and 7F),
which probably represent secondary inﬁll of the internal desiccation
fractures or are related to septarian cracks. Another possibility is that
the cracks have been made by gases, mainly methane and ammonia.
Harrell and Schwimmer (2010) concluded that in large fecal masses, as
opposed to the smaller ones, the gases produce rather radial ﬁssures
than more typical small vesicles, because they are conﬁned by the large
size of the coprolite matrix. The ﬁssures in crocodylian coprolites described by Harrell and Schwimmer (2010) are generally open, rather
than ﬁlled with calcite crystals, as in typical septarian concretions. Nevertheless, Thulborn (1991) illustrated similar concentric and radial ﬁssures
inﬁlled with gypsum.
6. Discussion
6.1. Origin of the structures
Several lines of evidence suggest that the specimens are fossil feces.
Firstly, the structures could not be transported as clasts of pre-existing
rocks, because they are collected from mudstone sediments formed
in a low energy environment. Formation of such noticeably pyritemineralized and in part organic rich structures is difﬁcult to explain by
hydrodynamic processes or sediment-burrowing organisms' activity,
because: (a) the structures lack larger plant remains and in only two
specimens the plant fragments size is constrained by the upper limit
of 2 cm, (b) they reveal no internal lamination. Even if speciﬁc chemical
conditions had caused decomposition of soft plant debris, we can still
notice the rare occurrence of wood fragments, which are everywherepresent in the sediments, as well as the absolute lack of bone fragments
or invertebrate remains in the structures. Moreover, the presence of
open cavities suggests that the structures were lithiﬁed through replacement rather than as simple concretionary growth (Chin, 2007).

Thus, the most probable interpretation is that the structures are of fecal
origin. This hypothesis is supported also by the fact that the size of the
structures is constrained by an upper limit.
Few collected specimens are elongate in shape (Fig. 5), nevertheless
in contrast to excrements produced by carnivorous and omnivorous
animals of characteristic elongate morphologies, those produced by
herbivores are usually roughly spherical or amorphous blocks (Chin
and Gill, 1996; Chame, 2003). Because the specimens are not phosphatic
(contain mineral particles, macroscopically visible plant material,
palynomorphs, and amorphous and dark organic carbon and are mineralized by calcite and pyrite), they might indeed have been produced by
a herbivore. The only herbivorous species known from the site is a giant
dicynodont. Possible coprolites previously assigned to dicynodonts
by other authors (Hunt et al., 1998; Souto, 2001; Hunt et al., 2007;
Fiorelli et al., 2013) are of similar sizes and morphologies. Phosphatic
coprolites of carnivorous animals, including specimens of sizable tetrapods, are also known from the site (Niedźwiedzki, in press). Thus, the
most parsimonious and probable explanation of the origin of the structures is that they are fossilized feces of a giant 5 m long dicynodont,
whose bone remains are associated with the host sediments.
Two specimens have a signiﬁcant content of plant remains. They include wood fragments up to 2 cm in length and a total plant remains
content of about 40% of the fecal mass volume. The spectrum in the
content and mineral composition of the coprolites is interesting and includes: (1) highly mineralized specimens with pyrite and a low content
of amorphous dark organic matter, (2) specimens with pockets of pyrite
crystals, amorphous dark organic matter and single plant elements,
(3) specimens with a great amount of organic matter in the form of
wood fragments. This probably reﬂects the variability of ingested food

ingredients and could be also inﬂuenced by diagenetic processes. They
could alter the geochemical conditions in the microenvironment of
the fecal mass and the organic matter could inﬂuence the mineralization processes, including formation of the pockets of pyrite. Organic
matter from the coprolite matrix was probably important for early
diagenetic pyrite production; it can be considered a favorable ‘culture’
medium for sulfate reducing bacteria in anoxic conditions. Nevertheless,
it seems that merely the diagenetic processes are not a sufﬁcient explication for the variability of the preserved specimens' content and the
coprolites can be classiﬁed in at least two distinct groups: wood-less
and wood-rich types.
Because there is only one known species of a herbivore at the site,
both specimens with and without wood fragments are parsimoniously
assigned to a single producer species and most likely indicate variability
in the diet, e.g. seasonal. It seems not likely that the coprolites would
have been produced by multiple herbivore species. Although dicynodonts are known from various Upper Triassic sites in Poland (Dzik
et al., 2008a,b; Budziszewska-Karwowska et al., 2010; Sulej et al.,
2011), bones of sauropods, the other group of sizeable herbivores of
the Late Triassic, remain unknown up to date.
6.2. Results from REEs studies
Geochemistry of lanthanides has been studied in marine waters,
rivers, lakes and groundwater (Elderﬁeld et al., 1990; Johannesson et al.,
1993; Mőller and Bau, 1993; Johannesson et al., 1996; Johannesson
and Xiaoping, 1997; Johannesson and Zhou, 1999; Dia et al., 2000;
Johannesson et al., 2000). Signatures of lanthanides are dependent on
pH, redox state, the concentration of ligands forming complexes with
rare earth elements (carbonates and dissolved organic compounds), sorption on iron oxides and hydroxides, and the composition of the source
rock minerals, which provided REEs to pore waters (Johannesson and
Xiaoping, 1997; Hannigan and Sholkovitz, 2001; Tang and Johannesson,
2003). Sea water and alkaline lakes are usually enriched in heavy lanthanides (HREEs; Johannesson et al., 1993; Mőller and Bau, 1993) as carbonate complexes prefer HREE than light rare earth elements (LREEs). Inland
waters and groundwater, and silico-clastic sediments usually have a ﬂat
(shale) pattern or the signature enriched in LREEs and middle rare earth
elements (MREEs). They may also inherit the signature enriched in
HREEs from the dissolved carbonate rocks present in the drainage
area (Johannesson and Zhou, 1999; Hannigan and Sholkovitz, 2001).
Non-carbonate coastal marine sediments and aeolian deposits are usually
enriched in light lanthanides (Elderﬁeld et al., 1990; Sholkovitz, 1992).

The reduction of iron oxides/oxy-hydroxides or phosphate precipitation
(Kreamer et al., 1996; Dia et al., 2000; Johannesson et al., 2000; Kocsis
et al., 2009) by binding of dissolved organic compounds (Tang and
Johannesson, 2010) can lead to enrichment in medium lanthanides.
Numerous works have successfully used REEs in paleoenvironmental
studies (Patrick et al., 2004; Martin et al., 2005), paleooceanographic research (Elderﬁeld and Pagett, 1986; Wright et al., 1987), taphonomy
and provenance studies (Trueman, 1999; Trueman et al., 2006;
Grandstaff and Terry, 2009; Rogers et al., 2010) and coprolite analyses
(Kemp and Trueman, 2003; Owocki et al., 2012).
Coprolite samples have 50–250 PAAS values at the spider diagram
with a distinct MREE-enriched pattern and a positive cerium anomaly.
The geochemical signatures of the samples overlap each other both on
spider diagram and ternary plot (Fig. 10). The so called “MREE bulge”
or “bell-shaped” pattern was attributed by Reynard et al. (1999) as
the pattern indicative for substitution mechanism of REE scavenging
in phosphatic fossils during the diagenesis. However, the analyzed
coprolite samples are depleted in phosphate phases and hence the
characteristic signatures may have been inherited from the original
diagenetic pore ﬂuid. The REE model for pore waters in the marine sediments (Haley et al., 2004) presents an explanation of the “MREE bulge”
in the studied coprolites. It is widely acknowledged that MREEs are preferentially scavenged by iron oxides both in the water column and oxidized sediment (Johannesson and Zhou, 1999). However, when the
iron oxides are reduced, they release the previously accumulated
MREEs, enriching the pore ﬂuids in the sediment.
The plot of Bau and Dulski (1996) was used to distinguish “true” cerium anomalies from the non-redox ones induced by the lanthanum
anomalies, commonly present in the aquatic environments. All coprolite
samples have redox related positive anomalies paired with negative
lanthanum anomalies (Fig. 11B) suggesting anoxic conditions in the
sediment during the feces diagenesis. Cerium and europium are the
only lanthanides that have more than one oxidation state. Cerium is susceptible to complexation by carbonate groups and dissolved organic
compounds but it is most notably fractionated from the other lanthanides in oxidizing conditions (Akagi and Masuda, 1998; Haley et al.,
2004; Seto and Akagi, 2008). Cerium oxidation and fractionation in natural waters is widely used to study redox characteristics of the sediment
and pore waters (Elderﬁeld et al., 1990; Dia et al., 2000). Positive cerium
anomalies usually indicate reducing environments, whereas negative
anomalies indicate oxidizing environments (Wright et al., 1987;
DeBaar et al., 1988). Seto and Akagi (2008) argue that the cerium anomalies in groundwater are an indicator of redox, provided that these

waters have a low content of organic compounds that can complex
cerium. In such conditions, a negative cerium anomaly may appear in
shallow groundwater when cerium is captured by precipitating iron
oxides (Akagi and Masuda, 1998), or bound by complexes of carbonates
in alkaline waters (Pourret et al., 2008).
In the case of the dicynodont coprolites the positive anomaly in the
analyzed samples may result both from the preferential scavenging of
Ce (IV) by humic acids and iron oxide particles in the water column.
Then, in the anoxic sediment the iron oxide reduction to pyrite and decomposition of the organic particles would have released the previously
accumulated Ce (IV) to the pore waters and imprint the anomaly in the
fossilizing feces.

6.3. Inference from isotopic studies
The δ 13C and δ 15N values of organic matter (dark and amorphous
organic matter) from three coprolites are presented in Table 4. A plot
of δ 15N and δ 13C average ratios of dicynodont coprolites from Lisowice
is given in Fig. 12.
The majority of present day terrestrial plants fall into two categories
based on photosynthetic pathways, namely types C3 and C4, which are

different animals (taken from Bocherens et al., 1999; Ghosh et al., 2003; Codron and
Codron, 2009) and the putative dicynodont coprolite specimens from the Lipie Śląskie
clay-pit at Lisowice.

characterized by distinct carbon isotopic signatures (Ehleringer, 1989).
Type C3 plants have a unimodal distribution around a mean of −26‰
while C4 plants are enriched, having a mean δ 13C value around
− 12‰. The carbon isotopic ratio of the organic matter within the
coprolite falls under the category of C3-type vegetation. This result
is not surprising, because Triassic ecosystems likely only had type C3
plants.
The nitrogen in the coprolites is probably derived from the undigested organic tissue (plant remains, collagen or bones etc.) from food, consumed water and bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract (Hollocher
et al., 2001). In the case of the examined coprolites, direct evidence for
bone or organic bacterial components was not found.
We compared the nitrogen isotopic ratio of putative dicynodont
coprolite organic matter (mixture of plant tissues, palynomorphs and
dark organic carbon) with feces of present day different species of
birds and mammals (Ghosh et al., 2003). The δ 13C and δ 15N values
are signiﬁcantly different for herbivores and carnivores. There is a decrease in 13C and an increase in 15N with a progressive rise in the trophic
level (Schweizer et al., 2006) and the δ 13C values are lower for herbivore feces such as the deer, supposed sauropod dinosaur, and plant eating birds, compared to carnivores. The putative dicynodont coprolite
samples from Lisowice fall between the data on bird feces and large carnivorous (tiger and leopard) and occupy the middle level in the plot.
The δ 13C and δ 15N compositions of the coprolite samples suggest that
the main food of the producer was plants and if the interpretation of
these structures is correct, our analysis provides biogeochemical evidence of herbivorous diet in this species.
6.4. Ecology of dicynodonts
Dicynodont coprolites described herein seem to be quite common at
the Lisowice site (more than 100 specimens were collected or observed
in the ﬁeld) and thanks to their black or dark-brown color are easy to
ﬁnd and recognize on weathered surfaces of the exposed mudstones.
Recently, Fiorelli et al. (2013) reported so-called communal latrines of
dicynodonts from eight massive coprolite accumulations in the Middle–Upper Triassic Chañares Formation, Argentina. Although Fiorelli
et al. (2013) for the ﬁrst time explicitly interpreted coprolite accumulation as possible non-mammal communal latrines, in fact various accumulations of coprolites of non-mammalian herbivores had already
been described from numerous localities, as for example from the
Upper Cretaceous Two Medicine Formation, USA associated with a
nesting ground of hadrosaurs (Chin, 2007; Chin et al., 2009), or the
Lameta Formation, India (Ghosh et al., 2003; Ambwani and Dutta,
2005; Sharma et al., 2005) and the Cerro del Pueblo Formation,
Mexico (Rodríguez de la Rosa et al., 1998). Triassic deposits also present
interesting localities abundant with coprolites of herbivores, as for example the Middle Triassic Santa Maria Formation, Brazil (Souto, 2001)
and the Upper Triassic (Norian-Rhaetian) Maleri Formation, India
(Vijaya et al., 2009). Defecation of dicynodonts in communal latrines reveals that this gregarious behavior is not unique to mammals (Fiorelli
et al., 2013). Therefore, it might be more common in the fossil record.
However, herbivore dungs simply tend to be common around sources
of drinking water and hence mass occurrences of coprolites in the fossil
record do not necessarily represent defecation in communal latrines.
Dung counts are a reliable method in estimations of animal population
sizes in modern ecosystems (Barnes, 2001). Social lifestyle, signiﬁcant
time spent in the water and favorable fossilization conditions may
also be responsible for accumulations of coprolites. In consequence,
fossil feces are among the most common fossils in many sedimentary
rocks (Hunt and Lucas, 2005b). Coprolites from carnivorous animals
can be common in sediments deposited in aquatic environments, but
coprolites from herbivores and fully terrestrial animals are generally
quite rare or rarely described (Chin and Kirkland, 1998; Chin, 2007).
In modern ecosystems, accumulations of feces produced by hippopotamuses are common in water pools. Onyeanusi (1999) discussed

12

P. Bajdek et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 411 (2014) 1–17

some aspects of the ecological role of Hippopotamus amphibious in
African ecosystems. Because hippopotamuses commonly defecate in
water, their excrements enrich the water in nutrients. Their feces
are also fed on by detritus consumers, as some herbivorous ﬁshes, and
hence play a role in water food chains. The swampy environment
habit of dicynodonts has already been suggested by Hunt et al. (1998,
2007) based on the fact that dicynodont coprolites are known from
dark mudstones formed in alternating wet and dry conditions including
periods of standing water. Dicynodont coprolites described herein come
from deposits of a low energy environment as well. Everglades-like
environment record in the Lipie Śląskie site seems to be conﬁrmed by
geochemical data (Niedźwiedzki, in press). It is noteworthy that several
massive coprolite associations, determined as a latrine deposit produced by dicynodonts, described by Fiorelli et al. (2013) represent autochthonous biogenic accumulations buried in a short-term ﬂuvial
deposition event.
A social life style of the dicynodont is also possible due to the significant amount of coprolites in the sediments. For example, hippopotamus individuals require relatively little space (Onyeanusi, 1999) and
congregate together in groups averaging ﬁve members, and occasionally up to 45 members (Martin, 2005). This is in accordance with conclusions of other researchers, such as Fiorelli et al. (2013). Moreover,
among modern mammals to form herds is one of the most common
protective strategies. Niedźwiedzki et al. (2011) described bite marks
on bones of juvenile dicynodonts from Lisowice revealing predator–
prey interactions between a large theropod Smok wawelski and the
dicynodont. Because coprolites of this theropod in addition to remains
similar in histology to therapsid bones contain ﬁsh scales and bones
(Niedźwiedzki, in press), these data on its habit highlight interactions
between the theropod and dicynodont due to the co-occupied
environment.
However, there are obvious differences between the dicynodonts'
ecosystem and the ecosystem of hippopotamuses. At night hippopotamuses leave the water pools to graze on grasses which compose their
main food source (Onyeanusi, 1999; Martin, 2005). It is clear that
grasses were absent in the Triassic ecosystems. Chin (2007) suggested
that a Late Cretaceous hadrosaurid Maiasaura peeblesorum intentionally
fed on rotting wood consuming considerable amounts of it, which might
be justiﬁed by the absence of grasses in the Mesozoic ecosystems. Wood
fragments have been reported a few times in coprolites of herbivorous dinosaurs and could also be ingested unintentionally while feeding on tree
branches (Chin and Kirkland, 1998). Nevertheless, most of the dicynodont coprolites at hand from the Lisowice site, contain no remains of
woody plants, which might suggest a high quality diet composed of few
ﬁbrous plants, possibly expected in swampy environments and perhaps
including aquatic plants.
Again, as in the case of modern hippopotamuses, it may be difﬁcult
to satisfy such a sizable animal's nutritional requirements only by feeding on aquatic plants, especially with a social life style. Recognized
palynomorphs and cuticle suggest that the diet of the dicynodont was
complemented with gymnosperms. However, because it seems that
all the cuticle fragments found in two coprolites represent a single
type of gymnosperm plant, it might reveal a selectivity in the feeding
habit. Nevertheless, it may be caused by poor sampling. Another possibility would be a restricted variability of available plant species as a
source of forage. A degree of selectivity in feeding habit and a highquality diet are supported by the absence of wood fragments in nearly
all of the coprolite specimens. Remains of different diet components
may vary between each other in resistance to decomposition by stomach acids or diagenesis and moreover could have been transported in
the gastrointestinal tract far from the place where the tissues were originally consumed (Bajdek, 2013). However, because wood tissues seem
relatively well-resistant for decomposition and diagenesis their absence
in most of the coprolite specimens is conspicuous. Only two collected
coprolite specimens are characterized by the high content of wood fragments up to 2 cm in length with rounded terminations (Fig. 6A, B). Their

dimensions, total content (around 40% in comparison to 13%–85% of total
wood content in the coprolites of Maiasaura) and general appearance are
similar to those from Maiasaura peeblesorum hadrosaurid coprolites described by Chin (2007). The digestion of wood is extremely hard in a
bacteria-dominated digestive tract of tetrapods (Chin, 2007) without
previous activity of fungi (i.e., rotting wood), the Late Triassic dicynodont
had no teeth (in contrast to hadrosaurids) and as it seems no functional
gastroliths (see Physiology of dicynodonts below) were detected in the
coprolites. Thus, it is intriguing if dicynodonts – at least occasionally – indeed complemented the diet with such a high ﬁbrous woody forage. Rotted, initially decomposed wood might be however well-accessible in this
Everglades-like swampy environment. It might also indicate general implications for feeding strategies in pre-Cenozoic ecosystems, before
grasses evolved and spread. Chin (2007) described also a second, less
common type of herbivore coprolite from the Two Medicine Formation.
Some specimens with a so-called gray coprofabric differ from those of
the woody coprofabric in being smaller and in a low content of wood. Because they were found in a close proximity to Maiasaura nests and sometimes contain eggshell fragments, Chin (2007) suggested that if they
were from Maiasaura as well, they might possibly have been produced
by juvenile individuals which required higher quality diet. However,
this seems not the case of dicynodont coprolites from Lisowice, because
there is, for instance, no obvious difference in size between the more
common dark gray coprolites and the specimens of high woody content,
although the two woody specimens indeed seem to be of adult individuals. Thus, the most probable explication seems to be temporal differences in access to diet components.
6.5. Physiology of dicynodonts
Stool form reﬂects the gastrointestinal transit time and can be easily
used to monitor changes (as sickness) in the intestinal function in clinical practice or research (Lewis and Heaton, 1997). Because the collected dicynodont coprolite specimens appear to represent feces that were
likely comparable in consistency, they are all equally interpreted as
feces of healthy animals, in spite of differences in content or the state
of preservation. Interestingly, Chin (2007) described the morphological
variety of Maiasaura peeblesorum coprolites that apparently reﬂected
different consistencies, ranging from compact blocks to some that had
a ﬂuid morphology.
For understanding the physiology of therapsids and consequently
for better understanding of the Permo-Triassic ecological events and
evolutionary trends, it is crucial to investigate the food-processing
mechanisms and efﬁciency. Interestingly, due to the high degree of
decomposition of the ingested plant remains, the dicynodont coprolites
at hand seem to reveal effective digestive processes.
About 30–50% of the mass of the coprolites consists of the HClresistant particles, including clastic mineral material of sand-sized particles. Following the terminology reviewed by Wings (2007) all of
those mineral clasts with a diameter larger than 0.063 mm and that
formerly retained in the digestive tract are classiﬁed as gastroliths.
Gastroliths, when present, can be excreted with feces and have already
been described in coprolites (Wings, 2012). However, gastroliths
may be ingested intentionally as well as accidentally and do not
always play a role e.g. in tritulation or mixing of foodstuff. Wings et al.
(2008) described a stomach content of a captive pygmy hippopotamus
(Hexaprotodon liberiensis) containing a large amount of gravel of the
mean particle diameter of 2–10 mm. It was however deduced that the
hippopotamus stomach structures acted as simple sedimentation
traps with no gastric mill function. Because (a) the diet of the dicynodont species at hand seems to be basically composed of very soft tissues,
(b) mineral clasts present in its coprolites are of very minute sizes and
(c) such particles could be easily swallowed while foraging in a swampy
environment, there is a lack of trustworthy evidence for a gastric mill in
dicynodonts. Most of the species of ruminants and also other animals
(amphibians, reptiles, birds) consume considerable amounts of soil

P. Bajdek et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 411 (2014) 1–17

while feeding. For example, bison (Bison bison) consumes sediments at
a rate of 7%, while sandpipers (Calidris sp.), which feed on invertebrates
in mud or shallow water, consume sediments at a rate of 7–30% of their
diet (Beyer et al., 1994).
It is commonly known that digestive efﬁciency depends in part on the
food mean retention time (Fritz et al., 2010, 2011). In herbivores, an increase in food intake causes an acceleration of ingesta passage through
the digestive tract and when in excess may paradoxically decrease digestive efﬁciency. Clauss et al. (2007) compared feeding strategies and food
retention mechanisms in two modern megaherbivore groups. In elephants, an increase in food intake is only slightly correlated to a decrease
in mean food retention time which allows elephants spend a signiﬁcant
amount of time (75% of the day) on feeding, optimizing the gain of energy. Meanwhile, hippopotamuses are limited by an upper daily intake of
theoretically 45–50 kg above which the excess of food intake drastically
reduces mean food retention time and the energy gain. Therefore, hippopotamuses are known to spend only 30% of the day foraging.
In spite of the huge producer size, the dicynodont coprolites from
the Lipie Śląskie clay-pit suggest a signiﬁcant degree of selectivity
while feeding, restricted to high quality non-ﬁbrous diet and when
not sufﬁcient, occasionally complementing the diet with woody ingredients, meanwhile eating more generally implies eating lower-quality
more ﬁbrous and hard to process forage. The coprolites of the dicynodont described here supposedly also reveal very effective digestive
processes (degree of the food ingredients decomposition). Therefore,
it seems reasonable that the metabolism of the source dicynodont species was much more modern hippopotamus-like than elephant-like.
This feeding strategy would allow the dicynodont to maximize the energy gain while feeding on limited amounts of higher-quality forage, rather than consuming large amounts of lower-quality ingredients. The long
forage gastrointestinal pass and limited amounts of consumed food in
the dicynodont are also supported by the fact that the dicynodont had
no teeth. Schwarm et al. (2009) have shown that the pygmy hippopotamus (Hexaprotodon liberiensis) has longer food retention time than the
more effectively forage-chewing bateng (Bos javanicus) and that in
mammals more effective mastication allows increased food intake.
The capacity of food retention depends on the gut volume (Fritz et al.,
2009). Herbivory requires greater complexity of the gastrointestinal
tract and often favors evolution of larger body size in both mammals
and reptiles (Fritz et al., 2010, 2011), as exempliﬁed by herbivorous
liolaemid lizards which are larger relative to their omnivorous and
insectivorous congeners (O'Grady et al., 2005). Niedźwiedzki et al.
(2011) suggested that the increase of body size of dicynodonts across
the Middle–Late Triassic was caused by pressure from early predatory dinosaurs. Not excluding explications of this kind, it seems that the gigantism of the source dicynodont species was a metabolic adaptation that
allowed increased retention time of limited forage amounts as it is in
the case of modern hippopotamuses. This interpretation seems to support the analogies to hippopotamuses. Such highly effective foodprocessing would be much more expected in mammalian herbivores
than in herbivorous reptiles (Fritz et al., 2010); there are however no
huge extant plant-eating reptiles. On the other hand, the supposed long
food retention time in the gastrointestinal tract seems to be a strategy
more typical for reptiles, as opposed to its initial chewing and fast metabolism in mammals (Fritz et al., 2010). Although mastication mechanisms
were not yet well-developed in therapsid herbivores and hence a long
food digestion was required in recompense, apparently the digestive
mechanisms were already highly effective and advanced, as supported
by the δ 15N values similar to those from feces of modern mammals
(Ghosh et al., 2003). Later on, development of the mechanism of chewing
in mammals, would allow the acceleration in metabolism.
6.6. Binomial nomenclature of coprolites
One parataxonomical concept of coprotaxonomy has been developed by several researchers who state that it would be useful to apply

13

binomial nomenclature to coprolites with the same type of system commonly used to name other types of trace fossils (e.g. fossil footprints;
Hunt et al., 2007). Binomial nomenclature has been applied to vertebrate coprolites a number of times (Hunt et al., 1998; Hunt and Lucas,
2005a,c; Hunt et al., 2005a,b, 2007, 2013) and at least 29 ichnotaxa of
Paleozoic and Mesozoic vertebrate feces have been established (Hunt
et al., 2012, 2013) as well as some Cenozoic coprotaxa (Aceñolaza,
2012). Some suggest that applying binomials to coprolites would
make scientiﬁc communication easier and that the lack of classiﬁcation
limits the utility of coprolites in paleobiology (Hunt et al., 1994). The use
of coprolites in biostratigraphy and correlation has also been discussed
and experimented for the Permian (Hunt et al., 2005b) and Triassic
(Hunt et al., 1993, 1998, 2007).
Nevertheless, this approach to coprotaxonomy is a controversial
concept and there is disagreement in paleoscatology about applying
the Linnaean binomial nomenclature to fossil feces' morphotypes
(Hunt et al., 1994; Verde and Ubilla, 2002). Whereas most authors do
not name coprolites (Owocki et al., 2012), others suggest that development of a binomial system of coprotaxonomy is one of the basic tasks in
paleoscatology (Hunt and Lucas, 2005a; Hunt et al., 2012). A. Hunt and
M. Lockley in Hunt et al. (1994) argued that vertebrate coprolites have
distinctive and recurring morphologies and that similar morphotypes
have been recognized from different Triassic formations. Meanwhile K.
Chin (in Hunt et al., 1994) was skeptical pointing out that feces can
vary depending on their quality of preservation or changes in diet of
their producer. She concluded that application of a Linnaean system
of classiﬁcation to coprolites would imply unsubstantiated taxonomic
differences (Hunt et al., 1994).
For a useful and justiﬁable application of coprotaxonomy and
coprostratigraphy, two criteria are important: (a) recognition of similar
and recurring coprolite morphotypes from different formations and
(b) the existence of a trustworthy link between morphology of the
feces and its source animal species. Ichnotaxonomy is, for instance,
commonly applied to fossil footprints thanks to the morphological
restrictions imposed on them by the foot morphology of the given
tracemaker (Olsen et al., 1998).
For example, because the scroll valvular intestine implies spiral
morphology of feces and the spiral valve is absent in teleost ﬁsh and
tetrapods, spirally coiled coprolites have been assigned to certain
types of ﬁshes, as for example sharks or lungﬁsh (Jain, 1983; Gilmore,
1992; Dentzien-Dias et al., 2012). Moreover, Jain (1983) noted that
modern lungﬁsh spiral feces tend to uncoil after a period in the water.
However, it may be difﬁcult to distinguish non-spiral ﬁsh coprolites
from those produced by tetrapods (Hunt et al., 1994).
Northwood (2005) described longitudinally striated coprolites from
the Lower Triassic of the Arcadia Formation, Australia. She suggested
that they were possibly produced by archosauromorphs, because
(a) such a coprolite morphology is known back to the Early Triassic,
(b) longitudinal striations have been observed in some extant crocodile
feces, and (c) some extant reptiles have longitudinal rugae in their
intestine. Such longitudinally striated coprolites are well known from
various Mesozoic formations (Ghosh et al., 2003; Northwood, 2005;
Hunt et al., 2007). Small, typically 2 cm long Triassic longitudinally striated coprolites were named by Hunt et al. (2007) as Alococopros
triassicus, meanwhile typically more than four times as long specimens
from the Late Cretaceous of Lameta Formation, India, were named
A. indicus. However, such longitudinal striations do not seem to be requisite for feces of Archosauromorpha, since they may be absent in some
coprolites (Niedźwiedzki, in press).
The identiﬁcation of the coprolite producer based on feces characteristics may be a subject of further research. It must be however noticed
that these few examples listed above are applicable only for high level
taxa. As for now, cases of identiﬁcation of the exact producer genera
or species of pre-Quaternary feces are very few. Usually, it is obtainable
only if there was just one large enough carnivore or herbivore species to
produce such sizable fecal masses in a given geological context (Chin

14

P. Bajdek et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 411 (2014) 1–17

et al., 1998), or putatively on the preservation of a swallowed tooth fragment in the coprolite (Stone et al., 2000).
There are numerous factors that limit or completely exclude the utility of the application of binomial nomenclature to classifying coprolites:
(1) Distinct animal taxa can produce very similar feces. For example,
feces produced by herbivores are frequently pelletoid, or blocky
and amorphous (Chin and Gill, 1996; Chin and Kirkland, 1998;
Ambwani and Dutta, 2005; Chin, 2007). Also, the feces from
many different carnivores have comparable shape and size.
(2) The same individual or species can produce a large diversity of
dung morphologies and/or dung contents depending on changes
in the food habit, e.g. seasonal, in age or health (Chin, 2007).
(3) Feces are easily fragmented, deformed or decomposed. Feces are
also a subject of invertebrate activity (Chin and Gill, 1996; Wahl
et al., 1998; Chin et al., 2009; Milàn et al., 2012). Moreover,
the state of preservation of fossil feces depends largely on taphonomic and diagenetic processes (Hunt et al., 1994; Chin and
Kirkland, 1998).
Indeed, fresh vertebrate feces can provide some taxonomic information (Chame, 2003), since (a) modern faunas can be studied, (b) direct
observations linking feces' morphotypes to their producers can be
made, (c) fresh feces are intact and undamaged and (d) interpretations
are not skewed by the highly incomplete and complex fossil record and
geological time. However, even modern mammalian feces' morphotypes
can be generalized as representing rather higher taxonomic levels, such
as Orders (Chame, 2003). Moreover, the DNA analyses of modern feces
(Wasser et al., 1997), are more credible than morphology in identiﬁcation
of the producer. For example, DNA analyses made by Davison et al.
(2002) have shown that naturalists commonly mistake pine marten
(Martes martes) feces for those of foxes (Vulpes vulpes). The taxon of
the source animal of fossil feces can be extremely difﬁcult to identify
(Chin, 1997; Chin and Kirkland, 1998; Bajdek, 2013). It is also not easy
to estimate the size of the producer. Although there is a slight correlation
between the total fecal mass volume and its producer body mass (Flessa
et al., 2012), some large animals produce large quantities of small
pelletoid feces. Thus, as suggested Chin (1997) coprolite volume should
be primarily used to infer the minimum size of the producer.
The chemical composition of a coprolite, as well as, animal or plant
inclusions are useful in the identiﬁcation of the source animal (Hunt
et al., 1994; Chin, 1997). Nevertheless, most often the producer can
only be deﬁned as a herbivore/carnivore, possibly with several potential
producers known from the paleobiological context (Owocki et al.,
2012). Moreover, recognizable dietary residues can be easily destroyed
by digestion (Bajdek, 2013) and diagenesis, and the chemical composition can be altered during diagenesis (Chin and Kirkland, 1998). All
of these difﬁculties can be exempliﬁed by established coprotaxa of
dicynodonts. Hunt et al. (1998) established Dicynodontocopros maximus
based on specimens from the Late Triassic Chinle Group, USA, with
the holotype UMMP 7255 (Hunt et al., 1998, ﬁg. 2A–B, 2007, ﬁg. 2J–K),
which was incorrectly listed as UMMP 7253. The diagnosis of
Dicynodontocopros ichnogenus (Hunt et al., 1998, page 228) was described, as: “Differs from other Triassic terrestrial vertebrate coprolites
in: being large (up to 10 cm long) and dark gray in color; preserving
up to 4 loose coils; containing large (up to 4 mm in diameter) blebs of
carbonaceous material; having a slightly arcuate long axis with one
end being broadly rounded and the other coming to an acute tip; and
having a maximum width to length ratio of about 45–50% in complete
specimens.”…
However, Hunt et al. (2007) admitted that some dicynodont coprolites from the Carnian of the Tecovas Formation, Chinle Group, Texas
(which also yielded the ichnogenera type) lack a distinct morphology.
Hunt et al. (2007) also suggested that some coprolites described by
Rusconi (1947, 1949) from the Triassic of Mendoza area, Argentina are
likely of dicynodonts, but they are more amorphous and differ in having
more rounded terminations and more consistent widths. It was

supposed that those differences are of taphonomic origin (Hunt et al.,
2007). Northwood (2005) also described a possible blocky and elongate
herbivore coprolite QMF39701-47 (Northwood, 2005, ﬁg. 2J) from
the Lower Triassic Arcadia Formation, Australia. She noticed, that the
specimen bears little resemblance to dicynodont coprolites described
by Hunt (1992). Fiorelli et al. (2013) described dicynodont coprolites
from the Chañares Formation, Argentina, with a variety of morphologies,
generally blocky and in some degree amorphous. Hunt et al. (2013) introduced a new ichnogenus of dicynodont coprolite (Santamariacopros
elongatus) for a slightly elongate morphotype from the Middle Triassic
Santa Maria Formation, Brasil, which was initially described by Souto
(2001). Finally, the dicynodont coprolites described herein from the
Late Triassic of the Lisowice site, Poland, are mostly blocky, or oval forms.
In summary, possible dicynodont coprolites known from the fossil
record of various formations are generally blocky, oval, slightly elongate
or amorphous forms. These characteristics obviously do not exhibit
any morphological criteria that allow them to be distinguished from
e.g. many dinosaurian (Chin and Kirkland, 1998) or even modern
mammalian droppings. Interestingly, Hunt et al. (1998, 2007) states
that Dicynodontocopros maximus is restricted to the Late Triassic (late
Carnian) and emphasize its utility in biochronology, among other
coproichnogenera. In conclusion, feces – especially if fossilized – do
not have the same morphological constraints imposed on them that
e.g. footprints do and provide little taxonomic information about the
source animal. Therefore, the binomial nomenclature should not be
applied to coprolites, since it implies unjustiﬁed taxonomic differences.
This renders most coprolites unsuitable for biostratigraphic purposes.
7. Conclusions
The enigmatic structures presented here show several similarities
with coprolites of herbivorous tetrapods (mainly herbivorous dinosaur
and dicynodont coprolites) and contemporary feces: (1) the overall
forms and composition (organic remains, microbial structures), (2) the
presence of micro- and macro-plant remains, and (3) the presence of
mineral particles (clasts). These coprolites from Lisowice provide rare
fossil evidence for physiology of large Late Triassic therapsids. It is possible that the gigantism of the source dicynodont species was a metabolic
adaptation that allowed these animals to maximize food retention time
and consequently the energy gain. Like some of the present-day mammalian herbivores, the dicynodont left rather medium in size and ovalshaped fecal residues. A wide variety of plant materials, such as pollen
and spores, cuticles, woody tissues of gymnosperms were observed
inside the coprolites. The diet of this dicynodont was probably of high
quality, it was however complemented also with poor-quality ﬁbrous
food components. This discovery also calls attention to oval-shaped,
dark, organic-rich herbivore coprolites in the Triassic terrestrial rocks,
such fossils may be recognized in other sites containing dicynodont
bones. The described specimens were not assigned in binomial nomenclature. Morphology, composition and size of coprolites can vary depending on their quality of preservation or changes in the diet of their
producer. The use of the Linnaean nomenclature for coprolites is in our
opinion a rather controversial concept.

Palaeobiodiversity analysis underpins macroevolutionary investigations, allowing identification of mass
extinctions and adaptive radiations. However, recent large-scale studies on marine invertebrates indicate
that geological factors play a central role in moulding the shape of diversity curves and imply that many
features of such curves represent sampling artefacts, rather than genuine evolutionary events. In order to
test whether similar biases affect diversity estimates for terrestrial taxa, we compiled genus-richness
estimates for three Mesozoic dinosaur clades (Ornithischia, Sauropodomorpha and Theropoda). Linear
models of expected genus richness were constructed for each clade, using the number of dinosaur-bearing
formations available through time as a proxy for the amount of fossiliferous rock outcrop. Modelled
diversity estimates were then compared with observed patterns. Strong statistically robust correlations
demonstrate that almost all aspects of ornithischian and theropod diversity curves can be explained by
geological megabiases, whereas the sauropodomorph record diverges from modelled predictions and may
be a stronger contender for identifying evolutionary signals. In contrast to other recent studies, we identify
a marked decline in dinosaur genus richness during the closing stages of the Cretaceous Period, indicating
that the clade decreased in diversity for several million years prior to the final extinction of non-avian
dinosaurs at the Cretaceous–Palaeocene boundary.

1. INTRODUCTION
A central goal of palaeobiology is to establish the trajectory
of biodiversity through time ( Valentine 1985; Rosenzweig
1995). Knowledge of this pattern, at various hierarchical
levels, can identify important macroevolutionary signals,
including mass extinctions and episodes of competitive
displacement, as well as revealing the tempo and mode of
adaptive radiations (e.g. Jablonski et al. 1996; Sepkoski
1997; Schluter 2000; Stanley 2007). To date, the majority
of palaeobiodiversity investigations have focused on the
marine realm, whereas trends in terrestrial biodiversity
through time have received less attention (e.g. Valentine
1985; Fara & Benton 2000; Benton 2001).
Diversity curves for Mesozoic dinosaurs have been
proposed by several authors, based mostly on raw counts of
genera (e.g. Weishampel & Norman 1989; Dodson 1990;
Barrett & Willis 2001; Taylor 2006) or phylogenetically
corrected genus-richness estimates (e.g. Weishampel &
Jianu 2000; Upchurch & Barrett 2005): the majority of
these studies dealt with individual dinosaur clades rather
than dinosaur diversity as a whole. Fastovsky et al. (2004)
and Wang & Dodson (2006) used more sophisticated
statistical approaches, including rarefaction and the
abundance-based coverage estimator, to estimate total
dinosaur diversity, but provided only coarse temporal
sampling that may have obscured or conflated important

features of the curve. Lloyd et al. (2008) presented the
most comprehensive account of dinosaur diversification to
date: these authors used a variety of metrics and attempted
to correct for possible sampling biases in their diversity
estimates by using a form of rarefaction and controlling for
differences in the number of known dinosaur localities
between time intervals.
Recent investigations into marine invertebrate palaeobiodiversity indicate that the quality and amount of rock
available for palaeontologists to search for fossils (e.g. the
areal extent of fossiliferous rock outcrop per unit time)
have a major influence on interpretations of diversity
patterns, and also demonstrate that many features of
diversity curves could be artefacts caused by changes in
global sea-level, tectonics and other geological processes
affecting fossil preservation (e.g. Peters & Foote 2001;
Smith 2001, 2007; Peters 2005; Smith & McGowan 2007;
McGowan & Smith 2008). Most previous studies on
dinosaur diversity have ignored or downplayed these
geological megabiases. Upchurch & Barrett (2005)
found limited correspondence between sauropod dinosaur
genus-richness and the number of dinosaur-bearing
formations (DBF, a measure used as a proxy for the
amount of available rock outcrop); by contrast, Wang &
Dodson (2006) concluded that rock availability had a
strong influence on the observed pattern of North
American dinosaur diversity.
Here, we document the palaeobiodiversity of Mesozoic
dinosaurs (inclusive of birds) through time and investigate
the relationship between clade diversity and the rock
record. We construct models of expected dinosaur genus
richness based on the number of dinosaur-bearing rock
units and compare these models with observed diversity

patterns. It is demonstrated that many features of dinosaur
diversity curves are sampling artefacts that reflect changes
in the amount of available fossiliferous rock and thus
reflect geological, rather than biological, events. However,
some of the reconstructed diversity curves exhibit
deviations from the palaeobiodiversity patterns predicted
by the geological model, suggesting that several of the
observed fluctuations in dinosaur diversity reflect genuine
macroevolutionary signals. This study represents the first
attempt to apply the modelling approach of Smith &
McGowan (2007; McGowan & Smith 2008) to a
terrestrial group of organisms, and thus has broader
implications for assessing diversity patterns in other
terrestrial clades.

2. MATERIAL AND METHODS
(a) Diversity estimation
Temporal ranges of 662 valid dinosaur taxa, ranging in age
from Ladinian (Middle Triassic: 237.0 Myr ago) to the end of
the Maastrichtian (end Cretaceous: 65.6 Myr ago), were
extracted from a recent global compendium of dinosaur
distribution and taxonomy ( Weishampel et al. 2004).
Dinosauria was treated as a monophyletic clade, with
Mesozoic birds included (other recent studies excluded
birds and were therefore confined to examining a paraphyletic
array of non-avian dinosaur taxa: Wang & Dodson 2006;
Lloyd et al. 2008). These temporal ranges were used to
construct taxic diversity estimates (TDE) by summing the
number of dinosaur genera present during each Mesozoic
timeslice. Genus richness was selected as the taxonomic rank
of choice, as the analyses of Robeck et al. (2000) demonstrated that data collected at lower taxonomic ranks are more
reliable than those obtained for higher ranks (families and
orders). Genus richness is preferred over species richness as
most dinosaur genera are easily diagnosed and monospecific
( Weishampel et al. 2004), with the effect that genus- and
species-level curves are exceptionally similar (P. M. Barrett
2007, unpublished data). By contrast, dinosaur species
determinations (in multi-specific genera) are often problematic and many individual specimens can only be identified
accurately at the generic level (see also Benton 2008).
Unfortunately, many geological formations that have
yielded dinosaur material cannot be dated precisely: as a
result, the timeslices used herein are based on subdivisions of
standard international stages, thereby reflecting the relative
coarseness of the dataset. Conversion of this information to
absolute ages (in millions of years) was rejected, as it would
introduce false precision. Use of stage subdivisions allows the
identification of many short-term fluctuations in the diversity
curves and provides a larger number of data points for
statistical analyses, contrasting with other studies that used
more inclusive time bins composed of several sequential
stages spanning tens of millions of years (e.g. Fastovsky et al.
2004; Wang & Dodson 2006; Lloyd et al. 2008). Nevertheless,
finer splitting of the time scale can lead to several problems
(Sepkoski & Koch 1996). The most significant of these occurs
if taxa are assigned to the wrong interval, as is more likely
with smaller bin sizes. Some studies, notably those of Alroy
et al. (2001, 2008), generated a series of time bins of equal
duration, following the methodology suggested by Sepkoski &
Koch (1996). However, we did not adopt this approach as it
would obscure the finer-scale patterns that can be resolved. As
this study focused on diversity rather than extinction or
Proc. R. Soc. B (2009)

origination, it is also likely that shifts in assignment of taxa to
intervals would tend to negate each other. For each taxon that
moved out of a bin, another would probably be reassigned to
that bin. Such assumptions have dominated the construction of
large-scale biodiversity curves (see Hallam & Wignall (1997) for
discussion).
Phylogenetic diversity estimates (PDE) were generated on
the basis of published cladograms for each dinosaur group,
which were obtained from Weishampel et al. (2004: see the
electronic online supplementary material). The more recent
cladogram of Butler et al. (2008) was used to provide a
broader framework for exploring ornithischian diversity.
Evolutionary trees for each clade were constructed by plotting
dinosaur cladograms against time, allowing the inference of
ghost lineages. The latter results from discrepancies between
the proposed time of taxon origination (based on the age
of the oldest-known sister group) and the first appearance of
the taxon in the fossil record ( Norell & Novacek 1992).
The temporal ranges of these ghost lineages were then
summed with the known temporal ranges of the taxa included
within the cladogram to produce a phylogenetically corrected
diversity estimate for each timeslice.
(b) Modelling rock availability and its
relationship to diversity
Relationships between rock record quality, TDE and PDE
were investigated using the number of dinosaur-bearing
geological formations as a proxy for the total amount of
rock with the potential to yield dinosaur fossils. Similar
approaches have been employed in several previous studies
( Fara & Benton 2000; Wang & Dodson 2006; Lloyd et al.
2008), and it has been demonstrated that the number of
formations correlates well with other measures of rock record
quality, including estimates of total rock volume and numbers
of sedimentary rock sections (Peters 2005). Peters & Foote
(2001) argued that formations are an appropriate proxy as
they record variability in the range of habitats (both ecological
and geological) preserved through time. By contrast, outcrop
area is more problematic, as a single, areally extensive
formation could be devoid of fossils. As DBF contain the
taxa of interest, this is a more credible subset of formations to
use than the total number of formations available (similarly,
modern ecological surveys do not expend significant search
effort in habitats unfrequented by the target group of
organisms), and the use of DBF provides some taphonomic
control. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that relationships between the rock record and diversity are not strongly
affected if unfossiliferous formations are also taken into
account (Smith & McGowan 2008). Information on the
number of DBF in each timeslice (1033 units in total) was
obtained from Weishampel et al. (2004). The resulting curve
of DBF distributions through time (figure 1a) was compared
with the TDE and PDE obtained for each dinosaur clade
(figure 1b–d ) using three statistical measures (Pearson’s
product-moment correlation [ r ], Spearman’s rank correlation [rs] and Kendall’s t coefficient) to elucidate the degree
of fit between the two time-series.
The method of Smith & McGowan (2007) was used to
develop a sequence of models in which rock availability
(represented by the number of DBF) was assumed to be a
perfect predictor of the TDE for each dinosaur clade. This
procedure involves sorting the rock and diversity time series
independently, ordering each of the timeslices in a sequence
from the lowest to the highest, and then fitting linear

similarity to each other. Finally, MDE were subtracted from
TDE to obtain residual values representing diversity signals
that could not be accounted for by variation in the rock record
alone. The last step was repeated, with PDE replacing TDE,
to obtain residuals of PDE from MDE. All relevant data files
are provided in the electronic online supplementary material.

3. RESULTS
(a) Dinosaur diversity through time
Ornithischian TDE and PDE present almost identical
diversity profiles (see the electronic online supplementary
material for statistical comparisons between TDE and
PDE for all three dinosaur clades). Ornithischian diversity
is low from the Late Triassic to the end of the Middle
Jurassic (figure 1b), although a small earliest Jurassic peak
represents the radiation of heterodontosaurids and other
basal ornithischian taxa. Ornithischian diversity shows a
marked increase during the Late Jurassic and plateaus in
the earliest Cretaceous before reaching another higher
peak in the late Early Cretaceous (Barremian–Albian).
A severe drop in diversity followed in the early Late
Cretaceous, but from the late Santonian onward,
ornithischian diversity climbed rapidly to attain its highest
peak in the late Campanian, with over 50 genera
worldwide. However, diversity declines to Late Jurassic
levels in the latest Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) with a drop
in taxonomic richness of 45 per cent (PDE) or 67 per cent
(TDE) between the late Campanian and the Cretaceous–
Palaeocene (K–P) boundary, although a small rebound
occurs in the latest Maastrichtian.
The theropod TDE (figure 1c) is very similar to that
obtained for Ornithischia, with significant diversity
increases during the Late Jurassic, late Early Cretaceous
and latest Cretaceous and a notable decline in diversity
during the Maastrichtian; however, the latter is less
marked than that observed in the ornithischian record
(25% decrease in taxonomic richness). A notable
deviation between the theropod and ornithischian curves
occurs in the Late Triassic, which exhibits a small peak in
theropod diversity at a time when ornithischians are
exceptionally rare (Butler et al. 2007; Irmis et al. 2007).
There are several discrepancies between the theropod
TDE and PDE: (i) the PDE show a prominent diversity
increase over the Triassic–Jurassic boundary that is not
present in the TDE; (ii) the heights of the Middle and Late
Jurassic diversity peaks are approximately equal in the
PDE, whereas, in the TDE, the Late Jurassic diversification is greater in magnitude; (iii) a significant diversity
trough is present in the PDE between the Aptian and late
Santonian, while a more complex pattern of peaks and
troughs occurs in the TDE; and (iv) the PDE indicates
that theropod decline during the Late Cretaceous began in
the Campanian (not the Maastrichtian as in the TDE) and
was more severe than predicted by the TDE (79%
decrease in taxonomic richness between the Campanian
peak and the K–P boundary).
Sauropodomorph diversity patterns share some similarities with those of theropods and ornithischians,
including peaks during the Late Jurassic, late Early
Cretaceous and latest Cretaceous and a major decline in
diversity during the early Late Cretaceous (figure 1d ).
However, the sauropodomorph TDE and PDE both
Proc. R. Soc. B (2009)

diverge significantly from the general pattern of increasing
diversity observed in the other clades: (i) peak sauropodomorph diversity occurs in the Late Jurassic, in contrast
to the other clades whose diversity peaks during the
Campanian (Late Cretaceous); (ii) numerous sauropodomorph taxa were present during the Late Triassic to
Middle Jurassic interval, while ornithischian diversity was
low throughout this period; (iii) the Jurassic–Cretaceous
boundary represents a major extinction event for sauropodomorphs (loss of 82 and 58% of taxonomic diversity
for the TDE and PDE, respectively), whereas this event
had little impact on other dinosaur clades (compare with
figure 1b–c); (iv) the earliest Cretaceous has low-diversity
sauropodomorph faunas, but witnessed rapid increases in
theropod and ornithischian taxonomic richness; and
(v) sauropodomorph diversity levels are maintained at an
almost constant level during the final latest Cretaceous
radiation of this clade (seen in the TDE only) and did not
decline prior to the K–P boundary. In general, the
sauropodomorph TDE and PDE are exceptionally
similar, but the curves diverge in two respects: (i) the
PDE record higher diversity in the early Middle Jurassic,
and (ii) taxic diversity peaks present in the late Early
Cretaceous and latest Cretaceous are not detected in the
PDE (figure 1d ).
(b) Influence of the rock record
in dinosaur diversity
As a first approximation, the number of DBF rises through
time. However, there are notable dips in the DBF curve
during the Early–Middle Jurassic and the early Late
Cretaceous (figure 1a). The TDE and PDE for
Ornithischia and Theropoda are strongly positively
correlated with the DBF curve ( p!0.01 in all cases;
table 1). Kendall’s t tests measure the synchronicity of
increases and decreases in rock availability and TDE or
PDE values: Ornithischia has the strongest positive
correlation with DBF, followed by Theropoda (table 1).
By contrast, the sauropodomorph TDE has a lower
positive correlation with the DBF curve ( p!0.01) and a
much weaker positive correlation is obtained for the PDE.
The rs test for the sauropodomorph PDE shows a weak,
negative correlation with DBF ( pZ0.02; table 1), and the
Kendall’s t comparison is also weak and negative.
Theropod and ornithischian diversities exhibit a general
(though not smooth) increase through time, with each
clade experiencing a notable reduction in diversity prior to
the end of the Maastrichtian, in spite of a peak in DBF
numbers at this time.
Models relating diversity to rock availability were
developed using TDE (see the electronic online supplementary material, table S3). The MDE are strongly
correlated with TDE in both ornithischians and theropods
and explain a large amount of the variance in the TDE
( rZ0.808 and 0.840, respectively), whereas the amount
of variance explained in the TDE of sauropods is
exceptionally low (rZ0.071). Correlations between MDE
and PDE are slightly different: values for ornithischians
(rZ0.826) and sauropodomorphs ( rZ0.077) are similar to
those obtained from comparisons between the MDE and
TDE, whereas those obtained for theropods are weaker than
that for the TDE ( rZ0.704). Although ornithischian and
theropod diversity trajectories are similar (figure 1b–c),
analysis of covariance demonstrates that the slope and

intercept of the rock models for each clade are all highly
significantly different ( p!0.01), indicating that genuine
differences exist, based on current data.
The modelling approach assumes that diversity within
a clade has been constant and varies only as a function of
DBF numbers per time interval. Consequently,
ornithischian and (to a lesser extent) theropod diversities
appear to be closely related to the number of available
DBF, whereas the latter measure is an exceptionally poor
predictor of sauropodomorph diversity. Residuals
obtained after removing MDE from the relevant TDE
reveal that in the case of ornithischians, most of the
diversity signals can plausibly be explained by variations
in rock availability: the only major exceptions to this
pattern are in the Early and Middle Jurassic, when
ornithischians are significantly less diverse than would be
expected on the basis of DBF numbers (figure 2a). Similar
comments apply to theropod diversity: a few residuals lie
below the expected range during the earliest and early Late
Jurassic, and two significant positive residuals occur in the
Late Triassic (figure 2b). Considerable differences
between the sauropodomorph TDE and MDE result in
the generation of high residual values in almost every
timeslice (figure 2c). Sauropodomorphs appear to be overrepresented in relationship to the number of DBF for
almost the entire duration of the Jurassic, whereas the
converse situation prevails throughout the Cretaceous.
Notable peaks occur during the earliest Cretaceous and
the Turonian–Coniacian. However, the wide confidence
limits mean that these results are not statistically
significant. Nevertheless, the weaker, sometimes negative,
correlations between the sauropodomorph TDE/PDE and
DBF (table 1 and the electronic online supplementary
material) suggest that this pattern may be informative, and
that the trajectory of sauropodomorph diversity did
deviate substantially from that predicted by the rock
record. The lack of statistical significance of the residuals
from the MDE is due to the wide confidence limits for
Sauropodomorpha relative to the other two clades
(compare figure 2a,b with 2c), which results from a
combination of factors: (i) sample sizes for sauropodomorphs in each time bin are generally lower than those for
ornithischians and theropods, and (ii) sauropodomorphs
exhibit high diversity in the Late Triassic to Late Jurassic
at a time when DBF numbers are generally low, in direct
contradiction to the assumption in the MDE: consequently, the MDE is poor at explaining variance in
the sauropodomorph dataset. Residuals obtained by
subtracting PDEs from MDEs show similar patterns to
those described for TDEs (see the electronic online
supplementary material).

4. DISCUSSION
Consideration of possible geological megabiases indicates
that many of the peaks and troughs apparent in dinosaur
diversity curves may not represent genuine biological
events, but should probably be regarded as artefacts
caused by variations in the amount of fossil-bearing rock
preserved through time. Caution is therefore necessary
when attempting to infer macroevolutionary patterns and
processes from direct reading of the fossil record (see also
Peters 2005; Smith & McGowan 2007; McGowan &
Smith 2008). Nevertheless, when such biases are
accounted for, several genuine diversity signals do appear
to be present. Perhaps the most intriguing of these is the
diminution of ornithischian and theropod dinosaur
lineages several million years prior to the K–P extinction
event: both clades underwent a drastic decline in both
absolute terms (as shown in TDE and PDE) and relative
to their predicted diversities (as shown by comparisons
between TDE/PDE and MDE, although this decline is
only statistically significant in the case of theropods;
figure 2a,b and the electronic online supplementary
material). This result contrasts strongly with other recent
analyses that either found no evidence for a reduction in
dinosaur diversification prior to the K–P boundary
( Wang & Dodson 2006; Lloyd et al. 2008), or that
explained the drop in diversity from the Campanian to the
Maastrichtian as a consequence of sampling issues
(Fastovsky et al. 2004, 2005): this difference that may be
due to the fact that the diversity estimates presented herein
are not based on methods that extensively resample the
raw diversity/collections data (such as rarefaction). This
observation supports the suggestion that factors other
than the end-Cretaceous bolide impact were responsible
for instigating a downward trend in taxonomic richness
that preceded the unquestionably abrupt disappearance of
many dinosaur taxa at the boundary itself (see also
Archibald 1996; Archibald & MacLeod 2008). It is
particularly notable that this diversity decline comes at a
point in the Earth’s history when the opportunities for
collecting dinosaur fossils are at their peak: DBF numbers
reach their acme during the Maastrichtian, suggesting that
this diversity signal cannot be accounted for by geological
biases. However, our results agree with those of previous
authors in identifying a pulse of diversification in the
Campanian (e.g. Fastovsky et al. 2004; Wang &
Dodson 2006).
In contrast to the theropod and ornithischian diversity
curves, sauropodomorph genus richness deviates strongly
from that predicted by rock availability models. The
reasons for this difference are unclear, however, as
sauropodomorphs are often found in the same geological

formations as the other clades (see Weishampel et al.
2004). It is possible that taphonomic factors may have
played as part, as there is some evidence for habitat
separation of sauropodomorphs and various ornithischian
clades during the Cretaceous (Butler & Barrett 2008), but
this observation requires further investigation. Nevertheless, our results suggest that geological megabiases had
less influence on the sauropodomorph fossil record than
expected. Changes in diversity recorded for this clade,
such as their explosive radiation in the Late Triassic, the
major extinction at the Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary and
the radiation of Late Cretaceous sauropods, might
either be attributable to other environmental factors or
represent genuine macroevolutionary signals (Upchurch &
Barrett 2005).
Lloyd et al. (2008) expressed concern that consideration
of geological megabiases might seriously compromise our
ability to recover genuine biological signals. However,
although we have presented strong evidence for the role
of rock record quality in explaining dinosaur diversity
changes, we have also provided evidence of independent
Proc. R. Soc. B (2009)

diversification trajectories for each of the three clades
investigated and figure 2 illustrates some intervals where
diversity is significantly higher or lower than predicted by the
MDE (see the electronic online supplementary material).
Lloyd et al.’s (2008) call for more refined models to
investigate the relationship between the number of DBF
and diversity should be addressed as it would clarify the
factors that are the most significant in changing our
estimates of diversity. However, it is striking that the amount
of variance explained by the MDE is so high for theropods
and ornithischians, especially in comparison with results
obtained for marine taxa (Peters 2005; Smith & McGowan
2007; McGowan & Smith 2008).
Studies are now taking advantage of the availability of
large, stable phylogenies that can be used to compensate
for some of the shortcomings of the geological record.
However, these serve to provide alternative models that
are dependent on the strength of the phylogenies involved:
just as the fossil record can be imperfect, so can
phylogenies. Combining geological and phylogenetic
data has a major role to play in constraining diversification

models to correct for the influence of geological megabiases and to reveal the genuine biological signals sought
by all evolutionary biologists.

## Next Steps

Once collection is complete, please update the collection summary table and provide details for each article in the appropriate sections above. This information will be used to:

1. Plan alternative research strategies for unavailable articles
2. Identify gaps in the citation analysis
3. Prioritize which citations are most critical for the overall research project
4. Determine if alternative or supplementary sources need to be identified

## Impact Assessment

**Critical Missing Articles:** (To be filled after collection attempt)
- Articles with >100 mentions that remain unavailable
- Introduction-cited articles that are essential for understanding foundations

**Acceptable Alternatives:** (To be filled after collection attempt)
- Related works by same authors
- Review articles covering similar topics
- More recent works citing these foundational papers
